  The Productivity System I Taught to 6,642 Googlers
</h1>

<p>Jeff Su’s CORE workflow is a simple, tool-agnostic method he’s used to train over 6,600 Google employees. It’s built around four easy steps:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Capture everything immediately
</li>
<li>Organize with minimal friction
</li>
<li>Review during scheduled sessions
</li>
<li>Engage by blocking time to execute
</li>
</ol>

<p>Within two weeks you’ll ditch reliance on memory or willpower and turn this into a smooth, automatic routine. The video breaks down each step, explains why it works, and offers timestamps and resources (templates, prompts, even a Notion command center) so you can plug this system into whatever tools you already love.</p>
