<p>After more than a decade of teasing us with Alien vs Predator crossovers in comics, games and that little nod in Predator 2, Caravan of Garbage finally dives into the live-action mash-ups: 2004’s Alien VS Predator and its 2007 sequel Requiem. The hosts poke fun at the films’ few high points and many missed opportunities, all wrapped up in their trademark snarky banter.</p>

<p>This two-part review serves as a tasty appetizer before next week’s deep dive into the first four Predator movies — so buckle up for more monster mayhem and witty commentary!</p>
