<p>Hi everyone! 👋 I’m Natasha Asnani, a Web Developer with over 2 years of experience in the field. I specialize in front-end development and love creating responsive, user-focused websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and WordPress.</p>

<p>I completed a CIT Web Development course, which gave me a solid foundation in web technologies, and since then, I’ve been continuously learning, experimenting, and building.</p>

<p>💻 <strong>My Learning Path</strong></p>

<p>My journey started with curiosity — exploring how websites are built from scratch. I began with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then moved on to Bootstrap to make designs clean and responsive.</p>

<p>After completing my course, I worked on multiple personal and professional projects, constantly improving my understanding of web design and functionality.</p>

<p>🧩 <strong>Real Project Experience</strong></p>

<p>I’ve completed two internships so far:</p>

<p>🏢 CodePro Software House — where I focused on front-end development, enhancing UI components and improving responsive layouts.</p>

<p>💼 XCL Technologies — where I contributed to the Sindh Government ICT website, handling both front-end and API integration, and worked on other projects as well, including refining the Toyota website and assisting in feature improvements for internal web tools.</p>

<p>These experiences helped me understand teamwork, deadlines, and how ideas turn into real, working products.</p>

<p>🌱 <strong>What’s Next</strong></p>

<p>I’m currently exploring React to build more dynamic, interactive, and scalable web applications. My goal is to continue evolving as a developer — creating meaningful digital experiences that blend creativity with functionality.</p>

<p>💬 <strong>Let’s Connect</strong></p>

<p>I’d love to connect with fellow developers, share experiences, and learn from your journeys too!<br>
