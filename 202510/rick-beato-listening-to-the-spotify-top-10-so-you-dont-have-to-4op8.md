<p><strong>Listening to the Spotify Top 10 So You Don't Have To</strong><br><br>
Rick Beato dives into the Spotify Global Top 50, counting down the ten biggest tracks and frankly asking, “What is this?” Expect sharp takes, unexpected reactions, and a healthy dose of “I just don’t get it” as he reviews each song’s highs and lows.</p>

<p>He also plugs his Ear Training Sale—get the entire method for $50—and wraps up by thanking his legion of Beato Club supporters for making the show possible.</p>
