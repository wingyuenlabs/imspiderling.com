  Why is Tron: Ares bombing?
</h1>

<p>Tron: Ares is underperforming at the box office despite being the third entry following the 1982 cult classic and a so-so 2010 sequel. Jared Leto stars as Ares, a program trying to experience human emotions in the real world—without Tron himself ever showing up—which makes for a pretty odd, head-scratching premise.</p>

<p>This take comes from The Weekly Planet’s spoiler-heavy review, dropping every Monday on YouTube, Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and wherever else you get your pods. For early videos and bonus episodes, swing by BigSandwich.co, and follow James and Maso on Twitter for more movie chatter.</p>
