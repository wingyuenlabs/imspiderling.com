<h3>
  
  
  How to Make It Worth Your Time
</h3>

<p><em>This is a submission for the <a href="https://dev.to/challenges/hacktoberfest2025">2025 Hacktoberfest Writing Challenge</a>: Open Source Reflections.</em></p>




<h2>
  
  
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>I've been doing Hacktoberfest for 7 years straight. Made every mistake possible. Learned what actually works.<br>
Below are the <strong>brutal truths nobody tells you about Hacktoberfest</strong>, and how to make it genuinely worth your time.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  What NOT to Do
</h2>

<p><strong>DON'T:</strong> Submit docs typo fixes or add your name to README files.</p>

<p>“This screams <em>I just want the t-shirt</em>. Maintainers can spot this from a mile away. These PRs get labeled as spam faster than you can say <em>open source</em>.”</p>




<h2>
  
  
  How to Get Real Value
</h2>

<p><strong>DO:</strong> Pick projects you'll actually use.</p>

<p>I contributed to a testing library in 2019 because I needed a feature. That PR led to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the library in my job</li>
<li>Meeting the maintainer at a conference</li>
<li>Getting my first OSS maintainer role</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Real value &gt; Free swag</strong></p>




<h2>
  
  
  More Truths for Contributors
</h2>

<p><strong>DON'T:</strong> Mass-submit PRs just to hit the PR target.</p>

<p>Quality beats quantity. Always.</p>

<p>I once reviewed 47 PRs in October from the same person. All low-effort. All rejected.<br>
The goal isn’t 4 PRs. It’s <strong>4 meaningful contributions</strong>.</p>




<p><strong>DO:</strong> Start with "Good First Issue" but don’t stop there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Year 1-2: I did beginner issues only</li>
<li>Year 3+: I tackled real bugs and features</li>
</ul>

<p>The jump from "good first issue" to "real work" is where the actual learning happens. Push yourself!</p>




<p><strong>DON'T:</strong> Ignore contribution guidelines.</p>

<p>Every project has them. <strong>Read. Them. First.</strong><br>
Wrong branch? Wrong commit format? No tests? Your PR goes to the bottom of the review queue.<br>
<em>5 minutes reading guidelines &gt; 5 days waiting for review</em></p>




<h2>
  
  
  Bonus Tips from 7 Years
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Keep a list of interesting projects year-round</li>
<li>Small bug fixes &gt; massive refactors</li>
<li>Test locally. Then test again.</li>
<li>Screenshots in PRs = faster reviews</li>
<li>Say thank you to maintainers</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  Real Talk: What Hacktoberfest Should Be
</h2>

<p>Hacktoberfest isn’t about free t-shirts, padding your GitHub graph, or 6 PRs and out.</p>

<p>It’s about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learning in public</li>
<li>Building real skills</li>
<li>Joining communities</li>
<li>Creating lasting impact</li>
</ul>

<p>Approach it right, and October becomes the month that changes your career.</p>
