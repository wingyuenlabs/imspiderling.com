  Rubio’s “El Tiny” Takeover
</h2>

<p>NPR Music’s annual “El Tiny” takeover (Sept. 15–Oct. 15) spotlights Latinx artists, and Chilean electronic-pop phenom Rubio brings her ambient beats into the Tiny Desk with a fresh twist. Backed by enchanting strings, piano and a raw rock edge, she evokes the drama of her homeland’s mountains and turns her punchy lyrics into something downright spellbinding.  </p>

<p>Her set—featuring “Hacia el Fondo,” “Seres Invisibles,” “Lo Que No Hablas” and “Voy Creciendo”—dances between shrill intensity and hushed vulnerability, proving that in those uncomfortable spaces is exactly where Rubio was meant to shine.</p>
