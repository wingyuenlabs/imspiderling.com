  Indigo De Souza – “Not My Body” (Live on KEXP)
</h1>

<p>Indigo De Souza takes over the KEXP studio with a raw, intimate live performance of “Not My Body,” laid down on August 31, 2025. She’s joined by Landon George on bass, Maddie Shuler handling guitar, keys, and backing vocals, and Lila Richardson on drums—all hosted by the ever-enthusiastic Ashley McDonald. Audio engineer Kevin Suggs captured the session, with Matt Ogaz on mastering duties to make sure every note hits just right.</p>

<p>A four-camera setup (Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen &amp; Emma Juncosa) caught every riff, and editor Carlos Cruz stitched it all together for a seamless watch. Dive deeper into Indigo’s world at her official site or jump into KEXP’s channel for extra perks and exclusives!</p>
