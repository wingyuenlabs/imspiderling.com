<p>Ghost of Yotei is shaking up your PS5 with three cinephile-friendly Director Modes: <strong>Kurosawa Mode</strong> strips everything back to moody black-and-white with a period audio filter, <strong>Watanabe Mode</strong> layers in a chill lo-fi score, and <strong>Miike Mode</strong> gets gloriously up-close and messy with extra blood and mud. Each mood is a playful tribute to a Japanese film legendâ€”perfect for mixing up your hunt for the Yotei Six.</p>

<p>Dive into Ezo, switch between these stylish filters on the fly, and experience Ghost of Yotei in a whole new cinematic light. Available now on PS5.</p>
