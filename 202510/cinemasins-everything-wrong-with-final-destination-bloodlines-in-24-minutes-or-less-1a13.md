<p>In this cheeky “Everything Wrong With Final Destination: Bloodlines” video, CinemaSins applies its trademark tongue-in-cheek critique to the latest chapter in the franchise, pointing out every absurd plot twist and over-the-top death scene in under 24 minutes. They keep it fun, call out the movie’s nonsensical moments, and remind fans that sometimes a little therapy (courtesy of BetterHelp) doesn’t hurt.</p>

<p>Along the way, they plug their main site and socials—YouTube channels (TV Sins, Commercial Sins, CinemaSins Podcast Network), linktr.ee page, a sinful poll, and Patreon—while crediting writers like Jeremy, Aaron, Deneé, Ian and more. For community shenanigans, they drop Discord and Reddit invites, plus Instagram and TikTok handles.</p>
