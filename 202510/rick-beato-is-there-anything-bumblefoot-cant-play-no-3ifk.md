  Is There Anything Bumblefoot Can’t Play? …No!
</h1>

<p>In this laid-back interview, guitar wizard Ron “Bumblefoot” Thal walks through the twists and turns of his decades-long career, spills the beans on his signature technical approach, and teases what he’s cooking up in the studio right now.</p>

<p>He also takes a moment to salute his My Beato Club crew—Justin Scott, Terence Mark, Jason Murray, Lucienne Kilpatrick, Alexander Young, and dozens more—whose support keeps his strings singing.</p>
