<p>Ezra Furman and her killer band (Liz on vocals/guitar, Ben on keys/guitar, Sam on drums, Jorgen on bass and Lilah on guitar) tore through a live take of “Jump Out” at KEXP’s studio on August 13, 2025. Host Cheryl Waters, audio engineer Kevin Suggs and mastering pro Matt Ogaz made sure every riff and beat smashed through your speakers, while a squad of cameras and editor Carlos Cruz captured the magic.</p>
