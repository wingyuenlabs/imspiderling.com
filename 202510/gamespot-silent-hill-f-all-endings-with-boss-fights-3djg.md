<p>Silent Hill f is a wild ride through five totally different endings (four of them throwing you into unique boss battles), plus eerie post-credit moments and even a surprise UFO finale. You’ll face off against Shiromuku (twice!), Tsukumogami, Shichibi and the gods themselves, witness Fox’s Wedding and the unsettling “Ebisugaoka In Silence” chapter—and yes, there’s a cheeky shiba inu cameo to keep you guessing. </p>

<p>All clear? Jump in and watch each showdown—timestamps included—for the full spooky spectacle.</p>
