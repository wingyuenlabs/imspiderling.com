<p><strong>Indigo De Souza poured her heart into a live KEXP session, delivering a haunting rendition of “Be Like The Water” straight from their Seattle studio on August 31, 2025.</strong> Backed by Landon George (bass), Maddie Shuler (guitar/keys/vocals) and Lila Richardson (drums), she turns every chord into a confessional moment, captured by host Ashley McDonald and audio wizard Kevin Suggs, then polished by mastering guru Matt Ogaz.</p>

<p>Shot by Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen &amp; Emma Juncosa (with Cruz also handling the edit), this performance feels intimate yet expansive. Dive deeper at indigodesouza.com or stream more KEXP magic at kexp.org—bonus perks await on her YouTube channel!</p>
