  Tron: Legacy – Caravan Of Garbage
</h2>

<p>Caravan Of Garbage delivers a fun, snarky deep-dive into 2010’s Tron: Legacy, where Jeff Bridges reprises dual roles as Kevin Flynn and his digital doppelgänger Clu in a visually dazzling sequel to the 1982 cult classic. Expect all the neon-soaked thrills—light-cycle combat, frisbee-style disc battles, parkour through the Grid and, naturally, Tron himself striding back into the spotlight.</p>

<p>The hosts keep things light and punchy, mixing witty observations with genuine appreciation for the movie’s slick world-building. And if you can’t get enough, they’ve got bonus podcasts, extended audio editions and video-game let’s plays waiting on their site and socials.</p>
