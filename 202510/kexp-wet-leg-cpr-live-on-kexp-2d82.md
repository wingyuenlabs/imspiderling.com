<p>Wet Leg dropped a sizzling live take of “CPR” at the KEXP studio on September 9, 2025, with frontperson duo Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers shredding guitars alongside Henry Holmes on drums, Joshua Mobaraki on keys and guitar, and Ellis Durans on bass. Host Cheryl Waters guided the session as Kevin Suggs captured the audio, Caesar Edmunds mixed it, and Matt Ogaz polished the final master.</p>

<p>A crack team of camera pros—Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen, Luke Knecht and Kendall Rock—filmed every sweaty riff, then Beckmann edited the footage into a must-see live performance. Catch more Wet Leg antics at wetlegband.com or tune into KEXP for your next in-studio fix.</p>
