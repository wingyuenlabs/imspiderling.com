<p>For my second Hacktoberfest contribution, I worked on improving the documentation for <a href="https://github.com/responsively-org/responsively-app" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsively App</a>, an open-source desktop browser that helps developers preview responsive websites in real time. The README was missing some setup instructions and quick-start steps, so I decided to make it easier for new users and contributors.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/responsively-org/responsively-app/issues/1407" rel="noopener noreferrer">Issue #1407</a> titled “Add missing documentation.” After claiming it, I created a <a href="https://github.com/responsively-org/responsively-app/pull/1436" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull request #1436</a> that adds a clear Quick Start, a short Dev Setup (TL;DR), simple troubleshooting tips, and a short First Contribution checklist. I also added a small helper file docs/build-and-run.md to keep the README clean and organized.</p>

<p>Working on this taught me how meaningful small documentation changes can be in open-source projects. I learned more about how multi-package Electron apps are structured and practiced using consistent commit messages, proper issue references, and clear pull-request descriptions.</p>

<p>After pushing from my <a href="https://github.com/kkrishnan10/responsively-app" rel="noopener noreferrer">fork</a>, I opened the PR to the main repo. Since Responsively App already has the Hacktoberfest topic, the PR automatically counts toward my progress.</p>

<p>Next, I plan to move slightly beyond documentation and try a small code or testing task in another project. Contributing here was a great experience and showed me how even small improvements can help others get started faster.</p>
