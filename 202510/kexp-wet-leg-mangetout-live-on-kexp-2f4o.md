<p><strong>Wet Leg’s “mangetout” KEXP Session</strong><br><br>
Wet Leg took over KEXP’s studio on September 9, 2025, for a lively live take on their track “mangetout.” Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers trade vocals and guitars, backed by Henry Holmes on drums, Joshua Mobaraki on guitar and keys, and Ellis Durans anchoring the bass.</p>

<p><strong>Behind the scenes</strong><br><br>
Cheryl Waters hosts the session while Kevin Suggs engineers the audio, Caesar Edmunds mixes, and Matt Ogaz handles mastering. A five-camera setup led by Jim Beckmann (who also edited) along with Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen, Luke Knecht, and Kendall Rock captures all the action.
