  What Pokémon Reveals About Peacemaker’s Earth-X
</h1>

<p>Peacemaker Season 2 plunges our heroes into full-blown multiverse chaos, seemingly landing them on Earth-X—the DCU realm where the Nazis won World War II. But a throwaway Pokémon nod in one scene might mean this isn’t classic Earth-X after all, but perhaps a new alternate reality where the Allies also fell.</p>

<p>Is that cheeky Easter egg just a fun wink, or a breadcrumb toward an even darker universe? And if it is Earth-X, are Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters next up for a cameo? Let us know your theories!</p>
