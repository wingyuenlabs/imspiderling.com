<p>Personally, I'm a huge horror movie fan. At the first sign of the Fall season, I start my annual horror movie marathon. While I often get movie recommendations for my Halloween film binge, I rarely hear people talk about their favorite video games for spooky season.</p>

  Resident Evil 2
</h1>

<p>I've been a huge fan of the <em>Resident Evil</em> series ever since the Gamecube remakes of the early 00s. Sure, they're a bit campy and the story doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, but the early games really did define the survival horror genre, and there are some genuinely terrifying moments throughout the series. The 2019 remake of <em>Resident Evil 2</em> is pretty flawless in my opinion, and a great introduction to anyone new to the series.</p>

  What Remains of Edith Finch

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsadwvehl2chrqzlr6nr1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fsadwvehl2chrqzlr6nr1.jpg" alt="What Remains of Edith Finch: A lone house by a lake in the woods with a makeshift tower addition that stretches far above the treeline." width="800" height="370"></a></p>

<p>A lesser known title but still a critical indie success, <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em> is a whimsical mystery where the player takes control of the title character to explore her labyrinthine childhood home. It's a slow-paced game, but the developers are masters at building atmosphere and suspense. This is an emotional tale of generational trauma and the complex relationship we can have with our own memories. It's definitely one I will never forget.</p>

<p>Similar to <em>Edith Finch</em>, <em>Firewatch</em> is a story-driven exploration game with beautiful art direction and unforgettable atmosphere. After a traumatic series of events, Henry takes a job as a fire lookout in the remote Wyoming wilderness. He spends his days patrolling the forest, guided by his supervisor Delilah, with whom he can only communicate via walkie-talkie. The solitude he seeks, however, isn't so easily won, as Henry soon finds he may not be the only person living among the trees. </p>

  The Last of Us 1 &amp; 2

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe0u8xqybdzb5oxy7ye5r.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fe0u8xqybdzb5oxy7ye5r.jpg" alt="A collage format: a young woman wearing a backpack fills the view, she appears beleaguered and scraped up.

<p>Finally, I know I'm late to the game (no pun intended), but I just recently played through <em>The Last of Us</em> series for the first time and... wow, that was a wild ride. If you haven't played them already I cannot recommend these games more highly. This is some of the best storytelling in a game I've ever experienced. I know the second game was particularly controversial for some, but most great works of art tend to ruffle some feathers.</p>

<p>Alright, now it's your turn: <strong>What are some of your favorite games to play this time of year?</strong></p>

<p>They don't have to be scary. I personally would love to play some more cozy games that evoke the Fall season. üçÇ</p>
