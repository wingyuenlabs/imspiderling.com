<p><strong>🚀 How It All Started</strong></p>

<p>When I started leading tech events, I used to manage everything manually — from sending reminders to creating event recaps.<br>
It worked… until I began handling 3–4 events a month. 😅</p>

<p>That’s when I thought — why not build something small that helps me manage repetitive tasks using AI?</p>

<p><strong>⚙️ Step 1: Setting Up Azure OpenAI</strong></p>

<p>I already had access to the Azure Portal, so I created an Azure OpenAI resource.<br>
Once it was deployed, I grabbed my endpoint and key.</p>

<p>Here’s the basic Python setup I used 👇<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>`import openai
import os

# Set your Azure OpenAI credentials
openai.api_type = "azure"
openai.api_base = "https://YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME.openai.azure.com/"
openai.api_version = "2024-02-01"
openai.api_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY")

# Generate a summary
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    engine="gpt-35-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a smart event assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize today's Azure Developer Day highlights."}
    ]
)

print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])`
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>🧩 Step 2: Automating My Event Notes<br>
I connected this script with my Google Meet transcripts and Notion workspace.<br>
So after each event, the assistant would:</p>

<p>Generate a summary</p>

<p>Extract 3 key insights</p>

<p>Post them to Notion automatically</p>

<p>The feeling of seeing AI do your admin work — priceless. 😄</p>

<p><strong>🧑‍💻 Step 3: Expanding It to a “Community Copilot”</strong></p>

<p>Soon, I added small features:</p>

<p>Auto-reply to students asking for links</p>

<p>Generate email drafts for thank-you notes</p>

<p>Suggest topics for upcoming events</p>

<p>Here’s a sample snippet for auto-reply emails using Python’s smtplib:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>`import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_auto_reply(to_email, subject, message):
    msg = MIMEText(message)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = "pavan@communitybot.ai"
    msg['To'] = to_email

    with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as server:
        server.starttls()
        server.login("your_email", "your_password")
        server.send_message(msg)

send_auto_reply(
    to_email="student@example.com",
    subject="Thanks for attending!",
    message="Hey! Here’s the Azure resources from our last event. Keep building! 💪"
)
`
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>🌍 Why I Shared This</strong></p>

<p>Because every community leader I meet says the same thing:</p>

<p>“I don’t have time to automate — I’m too busy managing people.”</p>

<p>But that’s exactly why you should automate.<br>
AI doesn’t replace leadership — it gives you time to lead better.</p>

<p><strong>💬 What’s Next</strong></p>

<p>I’m planning to extend this into a Teams + Zoom bot that joins meetings automatically, takes notes, and uploads them to Notion.<br>
If that sounds cool, follow me — I’ll share the full guide soon. 😎</p>

<p><strong>❤️ Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>If you’re a student, community lead, or event organizer — try building your own Community Copilot.<br>
You’ll learn Azure, Python, and most importantly, how to make tech work for you.</p>

<p><strong>💡 What’s one small thing in your work or study life you wish AI could automate?</strong><br>
Drop it in the comments — maybe I’ll build it next!</p>
