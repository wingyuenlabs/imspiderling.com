<p><strong>Bill Simmons, Chris Ryan, and Van Lathan</strong> team up to revisit John Carpenter’s 1981 sequel <em>Halloween II</em>, marveling (and questioning) why Michael Myers still can’t stay dead. Between debates on whether he’s the GOAT horror villain and shout-outs to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence, they dig into every spooky corner of Haddonfield.</p>

<p>Along the way they share their most rewatchable moments, argue through fun “categories,” and sprinkle in their trademark banter—proving that even 40 years later, the Halloween legacy still cuts deep.</p>
