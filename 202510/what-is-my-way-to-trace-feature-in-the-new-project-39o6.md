<p>Today, I'm looking into <a href="https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repomix</a>, which is a tool for extracting source code. It's similar to my own project, <a href="https://github.com/whyang9701/repopal" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repopal</a>, but it has more features. Repomix can be installed easily using the command line with this one line:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>npx repomix@latest 
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>You can also install it as a browser extension for:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/repomix/fimfamikepjgchehkohedilpdigcpkoa?pli=1" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/repomix/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One option I'm interested in is the <code>--remote</code> <a href="https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L211" rel="noopener noreferrer">feature</a> in the command line. This allows users to generate project source code without needing to clone the repository first. Hereâ€™s how I broke down the core implementation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Finding the Entry Point</strong>: Like many JavaScript/TypeScript projects, Repomix has a <code>src</code> folder with an <a href="https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/main/src/index.ts" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>index.ts</code></a> file as the entry point. I searched there first. If I'm working with a language or framework I'm not familiar with, I usually check the quick start guide in the documentation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using AI Tools</strong>: I used AI tools to get a brief explanation of the CLI entry point. This helped me quickly locate the code related to the <code>--remote</code> option without having to search through every imported package.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using Shortcuts in VSCode</strong>: I use Vim mode in VSCode, which lets me use a 'gh' shortcut to go to the definition of functions or variables. This speeds up my process. Without shortcuts, I would have to click around, search for function names, and check if I found the right definition.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, I found the core <a href="https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix/blob/16eb2e6511f7469dc1f34d81c878061c77b1e5d1/src/core/git/gitCommand.ts#L104" rel="noopener noreferrer">implementation</a> for downloading remote projects using Git. I plan to use this code to improve my own project.</p>
