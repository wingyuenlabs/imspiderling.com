<p>Hi everybody, it's me again: the engineer behind the popular '<a href="https://dev.to/tlorent/free-developer-growth-coaching-yes-really-4b8d">Free Developer Growth Call</a>'.</p>

<p>After speaking with 20+ developers from all over the world, I realized something: career advice should be accessible to all (regardless of time, budget, or experience).</p>

<p>So today, I’m excited to launch the next phase: a 1-hour masterclass. It’s something close to my heart — something I believe can make a real difference for developers at all stages of their careers.</p>

<p>And yes: it’s completely <strong>free</strong>.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why I'm Doing This
</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, helping developers grow is what drives me.  </p>

<p>Whether it’s unblocking someone who’s stuck, offering a fresh perspective, or bringing clarity in the chaos — we all need that from time to time.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve coached dozens of developers, helping them grow from <em>“just coding”</em> to <em>“making impact.”</em>  And now, I’m bringing that experience together in one focused, high-energy session.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🎓 Introducing: The Beyond Commit Masterclass
</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>From Developer to Impact Maker – 5 Keys to Career Growth Without Burning Out</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don’t need a new title to grow.  You just need the right mindset, the right systems — and the right kind of support.</p>

<p>In this <strong>free 60-minute live masterclass</strong>, I’ll show you the frameworks I’ve used (and taught) to help developers grow sustainably.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  5 Keys to Career Growth That Actually Work
</h3>

<p>These are the five principles we’ll unpack during the live masterclass:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  1. Side Projects — Build for Growth, Not for GitHub
</h3>

<p>The right side project isn’t just a repo — it’s a <strong>sandbox for growth</strong>. I’ll show you how to choose projects that strengthen your <em>visibility</em>, <em>impact</em>, and <em>learning focus</em>.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  2. Ownership — Act Like a Lead Before You Become One
</h3>

<p>Growth happens when you stop waiting for someone to tell you what to do. We’ll explore practical ways to take initiative and drive outcomes — no job title required.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  3. Practical Tools — Work Smarter, Not Harder
</h3>

<p>Your growth depends on your systems.<br><br>
I’ll share the same templates and frameworks I use with coaching clients:  <strong>Growth Scan, Code Commandments, Review Templates, and Weekly Check-ins.</strong></p>




<h3>
  
  
  4. Mentorship — Don’t Grow Alone
</h3>

<p>Every great developer has someone who helped them see what they couldn’t.<br><br>
We’ll talk about finding (and being) the right mentor — and how to make those relationships meaningful.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  5. Master Soft Skills — Communicate Across Disciplines
</h3>

<p>Your impact grows the moment you start collaborating effectively with designers, PMs, and stakeholders.<br><br>
Communication and empathy are what turn coders into leaders.</p>

  Final Thoughts
</h2>

<p>Sometimes all it takes is one new idea or conversation to unlock your next level.</p>
