<p>strongboi hit the KEXP studio on August 14, 2025, with an electrifying live take on “magic.” Alice Matthew’s vocals soared over Ziv Yamin’s keys, Dekel Adin’s bass and Matthew Roth’s drums locked in tight, while Eden Mechulam doubled up on guitar and vox and Paolo Guolo sprinkled in sax, flute and extra vocals. Host Kennady Quille guided the session as Kevin Suggs (audio engineering), David Parry (mixing) and Matt Ogaz (mastering) delivered pristine sound.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, cameras rolled under Carlos Cruz, Leah Franks, Scott Holpainen, Luke Knecht and Ettie Wahl, with Cruz also handling editing. Catch more from strongboi at strongboi.com or kexp.org, and join their YouTube channel for perks and exclusive content.</p>
