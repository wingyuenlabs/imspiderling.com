<p>Circles Around the Sun teamed up with harpist/vocalist Mikaela Davis for a special live studio session at KEXP on August 21, 2025. They ran through three tunes—Hot Pursuit, After Sunrise, and Moonbow—backed by Dan Horne on bass, Mark Levyz on drums, Adam MacDougall on keys, and John Lee Shannon on guitar. Host Troy Nelson kept the vibes flowing while Kevin Suggs (audio engineer), Dan Horne (audio mixer), and Matt Ogaz (mastering) ensured every note sounded pristine. A crack team of five camera operators captured it all before editor Jim Beckmann wove the footage into the final cut.</p>
