<h3>
  
  
  TL;DR
</h3>

<p>Cody and Neil are back on The Booth for another round of mea culpas (and they want yours, too). They chat about Neil’s big move to the ‘burbs’, debate hardware-store loyalties, share what they’re currently binging, unpack social-media feedback, and even recap Neil’s panel appearance at Columbia.</p>

<p>They also plug the Evans Scholars Foundation, give props to ServPro, Rhoback, and Stone Creek Coffee, and remind listeners to subscribe to the No Laying Up newsletter and podcast channel. If you’re really into golf (and light ad breaks), they’ve got “The Nest” membership waiting for you.</p>
