<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br><br>
After more than a decade of crossover hype in comics and games (plus a cheeky Predator 2 nod in ’91), we finally got live-action Alien vs. Predator films in 2004 and 2007. They have a few fun moments but ultimately don’t live up to the promise of the franchise.  </p>

<p>This video bundles two Caravan of Garbage reviews of those movies and teases a deep dive into the first four Predator films starting next week.</p>
