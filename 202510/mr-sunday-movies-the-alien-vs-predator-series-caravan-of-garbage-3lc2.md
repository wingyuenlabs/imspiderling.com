  The Alien VS Predator Series – Caravan of Garbage TL;DR
</h1>

<p>After decades of comics, games and a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it crossover tease in 1991’s Predator 2, we finally got two live-action Alien vs. Predator movies (2004’s AVP and 2007’s Requiem). These films had their moments but largely failed to live up to sky-high expectations.</p>

<p>This video bundles Caravan Of Garbage’s reviews of both movies and teases next week’s deep dive into the first four Predator films. Expect sharp takes, a few laughs and the usual banter you love.</p>
