<p>Today, I decided to challenge myself with a small C++ project. Being a junior developer, I wanted something that matches my level but still pushes me to learn.</p>

<p>I followed tutorials from <a href="https://programmingadvices.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProgrammingAdvices.com</a>, but I didn’t just copy — I experimented, debugged, and tried to write clean code in my own way. At first, I got stuck many times, but each mistake taught me something new.</p>

<p>⚙️ Here’s a source code of my project:<br>

<p>This small project reminded me that every step counts, and even tiny projects can teach a lot. Next, I’m excited to explore Blockchain and DeFi projects as I continue my journey.</p>

<p>🎬 Here’s a short demo of my project:<br>
