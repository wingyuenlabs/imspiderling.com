<p>Listening to the Spotify Top 10 So You Don’t Have To is a tongue-in-cheek episode where Rick Beato blasts through the Global Top 50 chart, scratching his head and asking, “What is this?” as he reacts to the current earworms dominating Spotify.</p>

<p>He also plugs his $50 Ear Training Sale to level up your listening skills and sends a big shout-out to all his Beato Club supporters—from Justin Scott to Toby Guidry—who help keep the music (and the memes) flowing.</p>
