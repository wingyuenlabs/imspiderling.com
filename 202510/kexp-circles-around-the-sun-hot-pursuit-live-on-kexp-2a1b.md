  Circles Around the Sun – “Hot Pursuit” (Live on KEXP)
</h3>

<p>Catch the four-piece psychedelic outfit tearing it up in KEXP’s studio on August 21, 2025: Dan Horne on bass (and mixing), Mark Levyz pounding the drums, Adam MacDougall weaving in those lush keys, and John Lee Shannon ripping on guitar. Host Troy Nelson keeps the vibes flowing while Kevin Suggs engineers and Matt Ogaz puts the final polish on the master.</p>
