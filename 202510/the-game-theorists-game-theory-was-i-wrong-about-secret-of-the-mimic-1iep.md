<p>In this Game Theory episode, MatPat throws himself back into Five Nights at Freddy’s: Secret of the Mimic, re-analyzing every frame and tiny detail of the game’s lore to see if his original theory holds up. He’s not flying solo this time—two other top theorists have their own interpretations, and MatPat puts them head-to-head to find out who’s really on the money.</p>

<p>Expect a playful, deep-dive debate as he tests each theory against the game’s hidden clues and twists, all while teasing what might come next in the FNAF universe.</p>
