  Tunde Adebimpe – “God Knows” (Live on KEXP)
</h1>

<p>Indie-rock frontman (and TV fave) Tunde Adebimpe dropped by the KEXP studio on August 6, 2025, for a raw live take of “God Knows,” backed by keyboard whiz Wilder Zoby, guitar ace Jaleel Bunton and powerhouse drummer Jahphet Landis.</p>

<p>Hosted by Cheryl Waters and engineered by Kevin Suggs (with mastering from Julian Martlew), the session was captured on camera by Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen and Luke Knecht, then edited by Beckmann. For more tunes, check out Tunde’s Bandcamp or swing by kexp.org.</p>
