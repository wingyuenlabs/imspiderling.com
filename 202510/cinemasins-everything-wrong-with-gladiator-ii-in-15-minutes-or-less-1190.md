  Everything Wrong With Gladiator II In 15 Minutes Or Less
</h1>

<p>CinemaSins just dropped a no-joke, totally serious sins breakdown of <em>Gladiator II</em>, complete with Denzel Washington praise and their classic “everything wrong” format. They even share an April Fools version if you’re feeling mischievous.</p>

<p>On top of the main video, they’ve got all the extra links you could ask for—polls, Patreon support, Discord, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram, and more—plus writer credits so you know exactly who to tag when you spot their next sin.</p>
