<h2>
  
  
  TL;DR
</h2>

<p>Predator 2 (1990) ditches the jungle for a crime-ridden, heat-wave-stricken Los Angeles and swaps Arnold Schwarzenegger for Danny Glover as its lead. You get a nastier new Predator, a bit of Gary Busey flair, and a fresh urban-thriller vibe—perfect if you’re up for something that feels familiar but not carbon-copy.</p>
