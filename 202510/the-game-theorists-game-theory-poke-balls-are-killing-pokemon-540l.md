<p><strong>Game Theory: Poké Balls Are KILLING Pokémon?!</strong> throws a wild curveball by suggesting that those cute little spheres might actually be lethal traps—meaning your favorite pocket monsters could be dying the very moment they’re caught. MatPat and his team tease a dark, head-scratching twist on Nintendo’s signature capture mechanic that’ll have you questioning everything you thought you knew about the Pokémon world.</p>

<p>Beyond the theory, the description plugs the new Theorist board game, the official Pokémon video games, and a free trial for Epidemic Sound, while giving shout-outs to writers Tom Robinson and Mike Keenan, editors Tyler Mascola, Danial “BanditRants” Keristouf, Shnaia “Naya” Llamera, and sound designer Yosi Berman.</p>
