<p>The Caravan of Garbage crew keeps the Tron celebration rolling with a playful review of Tron: Legacy, the slick 2010 sequel to the 1982 original. Jeff Bridges is back in dual roles as Kevin Flynn and Clu, the visuals are cranked up to eleven, and you get all the classic Tron staplesâ€”light-cycle battles, frisbee-like disc throws, frantic parkour and, of course, more Tron the man.  </p>
