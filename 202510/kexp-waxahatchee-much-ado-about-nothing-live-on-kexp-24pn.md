  Waxahatchee: “Much Ado About Nothing” Live on KEXP
</h1>

<p>Waxahatchee brought their signature indie-rock vibes to the KEXP studio on August 11, 2025, with Katie Crutchfield shredding guitar and vocals alongside Eliana Athayde (bass/vocals), Liam Kazar (guitar/vocals), Colin Croom (guitar/dobro/pedal steel), Spencer Tweedy (drums) and Cole Berggren (keys/banjo). Hosted by Cheryl Waters and captured by an all-star audio team (Julian Martlew, Charles Glanders, Matt Ogaz) and multi-camera crew (Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen, Luke Knecht &amp; Kendall Rock), this session is equal parts raw energy and polished production.</p>
