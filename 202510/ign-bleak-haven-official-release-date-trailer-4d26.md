<p><strong>Bleak Haven</strong> is a new first-person survival horror game channeling vibes from Resident Evil and The Ritual. Expect a story-driven, cinematic single-player thrill ride packed with puzzles, weapon crafting and some seriously brutal combat (PSA: that shadowy monster might ring a bell for fans of Inside).</p>

<p>It lands on Steam on <strong>October 27</strong>, so go wishlist it now if youâ€™re brave enough.</p>
