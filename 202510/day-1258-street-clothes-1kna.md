<p><em>liner notes</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Professional : Pretty good day. Got my slides set up for my workshop tomorrow. Sat in on a meeting to discuss the documentation site. I only really just add information to the site, so it was cool to see the decisions on what goes where.</p></li>
<li><p>Personal : Got a good version of a prototype printed and packaged. Looks pretty good. I also figured out how much I would charge the client to produce more. I also think I figured out how I want to make another possible product for the client so I researched some parts and placed an order. I also went through tracks for the radio show and put together the promo posts for the projects I picked up on Bandcamp.</p></li>
</ul>

A lighter, brighter opening in the center of the clouds suggests a break in the storm or the presence of light filtering through. The overall impression is one of immense scale and dynamic atmospheric conditions. The location is the sky above Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam." width="800" height="450"></a></p>

<p>Going to finish putting together the radio show. I just remembered a slide I want to add for my workshop tomorrow, so I'll be adding that. I'm also going to iron some clothes because I'm going to a funeral for a friend. I also need to iron my company t-shirt and another shirt so I can change into my street clothes before the radio show. Not sure if I'll get the chance because I have to get up early to head out to the hackathon where I'll be giving a workshop, but I want to work on some sticker designs and maybe that new prototype idea. So yeah, radio show after the workshop at <a href="https://kNOwBETTERHIPHOP.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://kNOwBETTERHIPHOP.com</a> and no study session on Sunday because of the aforementioned funeral.</p>

<p>Have a great night and weekend! Be safe!</p>
