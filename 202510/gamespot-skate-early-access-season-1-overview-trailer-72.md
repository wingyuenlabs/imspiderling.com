<p>Skate. Season 1 drops you into a living, breathing skate world packed with fresh spots, weekly Challenges, evolving Community Parks, new music and branded gear—and it even introduces the first-ever skate.Pass so you can stack rewards and skate in style.</p>

<p>Play free on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and PC (EA App, Epic or Steam). A standard skate.Pass track is in-game; go premium with an in-app purchase. You’ll need an EA account, a platform subscription (sold separately), a persistent internet connection—and maybe a little skate flair.</p>
