<h2>
  
  
  Starting Out — and Feeling Lost
</h2>

<p>I started my full stack software engineering career right out of college as a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed computer science graduate with <em>terrible</em> impostor syndrome.</p>

<p>Who can relate?</p>

<p>Between the firehose of onboarding information, a brand-new work environment, and an unfamiliar schedule, I felt completely overwhelmed. IBM ran large cohort-based onboarding workshops, and on top of that, I was meeting with different members of the team to learn as much as possible before jumping into real work.</p>

<p>When the time came to tackle my first ticket, I was clueless. I needed to implement a privacy auditing feature across the stack — which, at the time, used vanilla JavaScript on the front end, Node.js on the back end, and IBM DB2 for the database.</p>

<p>The codebase was relatively straightforward in structure, but it was <em>massive</em>, and I didn’t even know where to begin.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Pair Programming: A Turning Point
</h2>

<p>When I brought this up during our team standup, the lead engineer on the project, Devaraj, offered to pair-program with me.</p>

<p>I was nervous. Would I just stare blankly at a wall of code? Would he explain everything so fast that I wouldn’t retain a thing?</p>

<p>Instead, I was pleasantly surprised. Devaraj built the feature in front of me — explaining what he was doing, why he was doing it, and how the data flowed from front to back at every step. It was like watching a live masterclass in our codebase.</p>

<p>He could have completed the task ten times faster on his own. But by slowing down, explaining his reasoning, and letting me ask endless questions, he helped me gain both a deep understanding of the system and the confidence to contribute independently.</p>

<p>Within weeks, I was building features with some guidance. Within months, I was implementing them entirely on my own.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Exceeding Expectations
</h2>

<p>Six months later, my manager called me in to talk about my performance. Even with my progress, I still felt “green” and worried that I’d fallen short.</p>

<p>To my surprise, she told me I was exceeding expectations and should expect a bonus.</p>

<p>Excitement hit — and then gratitude. I couldn’t have achieved that growth without the people, like Devaraj, who took the time to invest in me.</p>

<p>And years later, I found myself in his position — mentoring new engineers using the same patient, hands-on approach he had modeled for me.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Introducing “WHAT”: A Framework for Mentorship
</h2>

<p>So what happened here?</p>

<p><strong>WHAT</strong> happened here.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT</strong> is an acronym I picked up while volunteering on the A/V team at my church — and it stuck with me ever since. It outlines a simple but powerful model for progressive mentorship:</p>

<p>W – Watch: You (the mentee) watch while I (the mentor) do.</p>

<p>H – Help: I do, and you help.</p>

<p>A – Assist: You do, and I assist.</p>

<p>T – Teach: You teach someone else.</p>

<p>At first, I simply watched Devaraj build the feature and asked questions along the way. As I gained confidence, I started to help, taking small pieces of the task myself. Eventually, I moved to assist, completing most of the work while checking in for feedback.</p>

<p>And finally, I reached the teach stage — mentoring others and passing along what I’d learned.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Applying WHAT in Real Life
</h2>

<p>The WHAT model is helpful because it brings structure and clarity to mentorship. It creates a shared understanding between mentor and mentee about where they are in the learning journey and what’s next.</p>

<p>Of course, the stages aren’t always linear or clear-cut. Even in the “Help” stage, someone might already have expertise in certain areas and be ready to “Teach” others. The goal isn’t to follow the model rigidly — it’s to use it as a framework for understanding and communication.</p>

<p>When applied intentionally, WHAT helps both sides see progress, build confidence, and ultimately create a culture of continuous learning.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Takeaways
</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Effective mentorship compounds growth.</strong> By slowing down to teach, mentors create ripple effects that elevate entire teams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Structured learning builds confidence.</strong> The WHAT framework gives mentees a roadmap for their development.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teaching reinforces mastery.</strong> When you teach others, you deepen your own understanding — completing the cycle.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you’re a new engineer or a seasoned leader, adopting a “WHAT” mindset can help you turn knowledge into shared success — and transform impostor syndrome into empowerment.</p>
