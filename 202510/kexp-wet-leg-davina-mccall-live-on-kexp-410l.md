  Wet Leg live on KEXP
</h2>

<p>Wet Leg drops a punchy rendition of “davina mccall” straight from the KEXP studio on September 9, 2025. Fronted by Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers on vocals and guitars, they’re backed by Henry Holmes on drums, Joshua Mobaraki on guitar and keys, and Ellis Durans on bass—all chiming in with harmonies and tight indie-rock riffs.</p>

<p>Hosted by Cheryl Waters, this session was engineered by Kevin Suggs, mixed by Caesar Edmunds, and mastered by Matt Ogaz. Cameras rolled thanks to Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen, Luke Knecht &amp; Kendall Rock, with Jim Beckmann also handling editing.
