<p><strong>Circles Around the Sun</strong> rolled into the KEXP studio on August 21, 2025, and tore through a fiery live version of “Hot Pursuit.” The four-piece—Dan Horne on bass, Mark Levyz on drums, Adam MacDougall on keys and John Lee Shannon on guitar—laid down some serious instrumental grooves under host Troy Nelson’s watchful ear.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, audio engineer Kevin Suggs, mixer Dan Horne and mastering whiz Matt Ogaz polished the sound, while a crack team of camera operators and editor Jim Beckmann made sure you caught every riff. Catch more from the band on their Bandcamp page or dive into the full performance at KEXP.org.</p>
