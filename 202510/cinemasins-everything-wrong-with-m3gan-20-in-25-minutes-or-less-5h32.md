<h1>
  
  
  TL;DR
</h1>

<p>CinemaSins just dropped “Everything Wrong With M3GAN 2.0 In 25 Minutes Or Less,” and their verdict is that the sequel is… kind of a snoozefest. Besides piling on the sins, they’re pointing you to their main site, socials (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Discord, Reddit), a quick poll to spill your thoughts, and a Patreon link to support the channel.  </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Who’s Behind It?
</h2>

<p>The film roast is penned by Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian and Daniel—all linked to their personal socials—so you know who to thank (or blame) for every sin you hear.  </p>
