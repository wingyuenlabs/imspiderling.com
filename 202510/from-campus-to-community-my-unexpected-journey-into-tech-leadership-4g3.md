<p><strong>“You don’t need to be the smartest person in the room — just the one who brings people together.”</strong></p>

<p>That line changed everything for me.</p>

<p><strong>👋 Where It All Began</strong></p>

<p>My journey didn’t start with a fancy laptop or a coding competition.<br>
It started with curiosity — and a small community event poster that said “Azure Developer Day – Join Us!”</p>

<p>Back then, I was a student in India, trying to understand how technology could shape the future. I attended that event just to learn about cloud computing. But that day, something clicked — not about code, but about people.</p>

<p><strong>🚀 Becoming Part of Something Bigger</strong><br>
Soon, I joined Reskilll and Microsoft’s Azure Developer Community (ADC) — first as a participant, then as a volunteer, and later as a Community Lead.</p>

<p><strong>Organizing events taught me things no classroom ever could:</strong></p>

<p>How to plan and promote sessions with 150+ attendees<br>
How to coordinate speakers, sponsors, and students<br>
How to stay calm when the projector stops working mid-session 😅</p>

<p>Every event felt like a new challenge — and a new story to tell.</p>

<p><strong>💡 When AI Entered the Picture</strong><br>
In 2024, everything shifted again.<br>
I started experimenting with Azure AI, OpenAI APIs, and Python automation to make my community work smarter.</p>

<p>One weekend, I built a small bot that joined my meetings and sent summaries to my Notion dashboard.<br>
It wasn’t perfect — but it saved hours. That’s when I realized:</p>

<p>AI isn’t just for data scientists. It’s for community builders, organizers, and anyone who wants to amplify their impact.</p>

<p><strong>✈️ Moving to the UK — and Starting Over</strong></p>

<p>When I came to the UK for my Master’s at BPP University, I thought I’d have to start from scratch.<br>
But communities travel with you — not as organizations, but as mindsets.</p>

<p>I started reaching out to local developers, students, and professionals. Slowly, I rebuilt what I had back home — one connection, one message, and one event at a time.</p>

<p><strong>🧩 Lessons I Learned Along the Way</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. You don’t need permission to start.</strong><br>
When I organized my first event, I didn’t have sponsors or a venue — just a plan and people who believed in it.</p>

<p><strong>2. Community is your biggest teacher.</strong><br>
I’ve learned more from conversations with developers, speakers, and students than from any single course.</p>

<p><strong>3. Stay humble, stay curious.</strong><br>
Every time I think I know enough, someone new joins a call and blows my mind with their ideas.</p>

<p><strong>⚙️ What I’m Building Now</strong><br>
Today, I’m working on:</p>

<p><strong>Technical Spaces</strong> — my initiative to empower tech communities across India and the UK</p>

<p><strong>AI-powered community tools</strong> like event assistants and note-taking bots</p>

<p><strong>Cross-border events connecting Indian and UK students with global tech ecosystems</strong></p>

<p><strong>The dream?</strong><br>
To build a world where community and technology grow together — empowering every learner to become a leader.</p>

<p><strong>❤️ Final Thought</strong><br>
If you’re reading this and wondering where to start — don’t wait for the “perfect opportunity.”<br>
Start where you are.<br>
Join a community. Volunteer. Help. Host. Fail. Learn.<br>
Because one small event could be the start of your story too</p>
