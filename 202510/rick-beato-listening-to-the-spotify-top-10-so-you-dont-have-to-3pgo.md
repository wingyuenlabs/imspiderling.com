  Listening to the Spotify Top 10 So You Don’t Have To
</h1>

<p>Rick Beato dives into the Spotify Global Top 50, counts down the ten biggest tracks and can’t help but ask, “What is this?” Expect his trademark blend of genuine bafflement and musical insights as he breaks down what’s ruling the charts.</p>

<p>He’s also champing at you to grab his full ear‐training method for just $50, and wraps up the episode by thanking his Beato Club supporters for keeping the tunes—and the coffee—flowing.</p>
