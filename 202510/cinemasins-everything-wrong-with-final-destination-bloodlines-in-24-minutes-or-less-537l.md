<p>Everything Wrong With Final Destination: Bloodlines in 24 Minutes or Less delivers CinemaSins’ signature blend of sarcastic quips and nitpicks as it gleefully picks apart the movie’s “death logic,” all while reminding you that, yes, it’s still hilarious nonsense. Along the way they sneak in a BetterHelp therapy plug for anyone who needs a laugh—or an actual therapist.</p>

<p>Besides the main roast, they point you to the rest of the CinemaSins universe—TVSins, CommercialSins, their Patreon, a fan poll, Discord, Reddit, and all their social profiles—plus a shout-out to the writing squad behind the scenes.</p>
