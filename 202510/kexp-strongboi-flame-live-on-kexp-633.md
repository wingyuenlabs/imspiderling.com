<p>strongboi just dropped a sizzling live take on “flame” straight from KEXP’s Seattle studio (recorded August 14, 2025). Fronted by Alice Matthew’s vocals and powered by Ziv Yamin (keys), Dekel Adin (bass), Matthew Roth (drums), Eden Mechulam (guitar/vox) and Paolo Guolo’s sax, flute and backing vocals, this performance brings raw energy and tight grooves you won’t forget.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Kennady Quille hosts while Kevin Suggs (audio engineer), David Parry (mixer) and Matt Ogaz (mastering) lock in the sound. Cameras roll courtesy of Carlos Cruz, Leah Franks, Scott Holpainen, Luke Knecht &amp; Ettie Wahl, with Carlos Cruz editing. Catch the full session on KEXP.ORG or at strongboi.com.</p>
