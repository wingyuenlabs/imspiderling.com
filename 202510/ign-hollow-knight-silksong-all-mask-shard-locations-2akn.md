<p>Silksong kicks off Hornet with five masks of health, but you can double that by hunting down 20 mask shards hidden across Pharloom—every four shards earns you an extra mask.  </p>

<p>From the muck of Bone Bottom and the winding Wormways to the clockwork depths of Cogwork Core and the heights of Mount Fay (with bonus Act 3 spawns in Far Fields and Bellhart), this guide pinpoints every shard location so you can buff up your HP and tackle Silksong’s toughest foes in style.</p>
