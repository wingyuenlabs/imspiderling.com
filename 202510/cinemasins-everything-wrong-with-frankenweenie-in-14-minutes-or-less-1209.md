  Everything Wrong With <em>Frankenweenie</em> in 14 Minutes (Or Less)
</h2>

<p>CinemaSins is back to “sin” Tim Burton’s <em>Frankenweenie</em> for the second time—this go-round they’re congratulating the film while still poking fun at every nitpick and narrative quirk in just 14 minutes of snarky commentary.</p>

<p>They’ve linked up all their usual goodies: website, multiple YouTube channels (@TVSins, @commercialsins, @cinemasinspodcastnetwork), social hubs (Discord, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok), a sinful poll, Patreon support, and even a book by Jeremy! Plus, meet the writers behind every cheeky critique.</p>
