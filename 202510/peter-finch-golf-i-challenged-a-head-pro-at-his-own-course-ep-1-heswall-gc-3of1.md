<p>I laced up at Heswall GC and threw down a <strong>£1,000</strong> gauntlet to the head pro in the first episode of my new series. Titleist is backing the match (and club pros across the UK) and has even pledged to support Heswall’s junior section off the back of this showdown.</p>

<p>Massive thanks to Tom and the amazing folks at Heswall GC for hosting. Dive into Heswall’s course details at <a href="https://www.heswallgolfclub.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.heswallgolfclub.com</a> or check my Linktree for all the gear and kit info (with a sweet discount!).</p>
