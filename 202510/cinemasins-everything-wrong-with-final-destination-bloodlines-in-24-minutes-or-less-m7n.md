<p>Everything Wrong With Final Destination: Bloodlines is CinemaSins’ trademark 24-minute roast of the movie’s over-the-top deaths and plot holes—“fun nonsense” that still follows the franchise’s chaotic rules. They even slip in a BetterHelp sponsor shout-out for anyone needing therapy after witnessing all those sins.</p>

<p>Between sin counts, they hype their main site, YouTube channels (@TVSins, @CommercialSins, @CinemaSinsPodcastNetwork), Discord, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok and drop a poll for viewer feedback plus a Patreon link. They also credit their writing squad (Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian and Daniel) and mention Jeremy’s book for fans craving more nitpicks.</p>
