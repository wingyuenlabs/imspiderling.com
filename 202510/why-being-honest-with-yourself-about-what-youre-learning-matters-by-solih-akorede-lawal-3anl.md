<p>How It All Started</p>

<p>Last year, I wrote an article titled “Why Am I Learning This? Understanding the Purpose Behind Your Education.”</p>

<p>At that time, I was a web developer in training — writing code, building interfaces, and learning the logic behind web technologies. I believed I loved it, but deep down, I was following the trend, not my truth.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize it then — but I was learning for the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>The Turning Point</p>

<p>By December last year, I began to feel stuck. I asked myself tough questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Why am I learning this?”</li>
<li>“Is this really what I want?”</li>
<li>“Would I still be happy doing this in 10 years?”</li>
</ul>

<p>For weeks, I couldn’t find clear answers. I felt lost — like I was learning, but not growing.</p>

<p>Then I noticed something small but powerful — I loved using AI tools like ChatGPT.<br>
It fascinated me how AI could understand, summarize, and even create ideas.</p>

<p>That was my spark.<br>
I told myself, “What if I could build my own AI model or something that uses AI?”</p>

<p>My First Step into AI</p>

<p>The first thing I built was an AI Text Summarizer, after completing a Postman API course.<br>
That moment — watching my project summarize text automatically — gave me so much joy and confidence.</p>

<p>I realized: This is it. This is my lane.</p>

<p>That’s how my journey into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning began.</p>

<p>Finding My Focus: Computer Vision</p>

<p>When I started exploring AI, I came across several areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Deep Learning</li>
<li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
<li>Computer Vision</li>
<li>Robotics</li>
<li>AI Ethics</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I discovered Computer Vision — and everything clicked.<br>
The idea of teaching machines to see and understand the world the way humans do fascinated me.<br>
That’s where I decided to focus.</p>

<p>What I Learned</p>

<p>Looking back at my old article made me realize something important:<br>
I wasn’t being honest with myself about why I was learning web development.</p>

<p>But I’m glad I discovered the truth early enough to change direction.</p>

<p>🧩 The Takeaway</p>

<p>If you’re learning or working on something just because it’s popular, take a step back and reflect:</p>

<p>Are you genuinely passionate about it?</p>

<p>Does it align with your goals?</p>

<p>Would you still be excited about it years from now?</p>

<p>If not — it’s okay to start over.</p>

<p>Change can be uncomfortable, but being honest with yourself is the first step toward a fulfilling career.</p>

<p>It’s never too late to realign, refocus, and rediscover what truly makes you happy.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>

<p>Finding your path takes time — but every wrong turn teaches you something.<br>
I’m grateful for my web development journey because it led me to discover my love for AI and Computer Vision.</p>

<p>So if you’re at that crossroads, unsure of what’s next — take a deep breath, be honest with yourself, and keep exploring.<br>
You might just find the path you were meant to take all along.</p>
