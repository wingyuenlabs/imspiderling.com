<p>Tunde Adebimpe just lit up the KEXP studio with a spellbinding live take on “Ate The Moon,” recorded August 6, 2025. Backed by Wilder Zoby’s keys, Jaleel Bunton’s guitar riffs and Jahphet Landis’s drums, his vocals float effortlessly over the ethereal groove.</p>

<p>Hosted by Cheryl Waters and captured by a dream team of engineers (Kevin Suggs on audio, Julian Martlew mastering) and camera wizards (Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen &amp; Luke Knecht), this session’s as tight as it gets.
