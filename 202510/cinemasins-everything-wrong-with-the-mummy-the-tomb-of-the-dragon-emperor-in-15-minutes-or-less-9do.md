<h1>
  
  
  TL;DR
</h1>

<p>CinemaSins tackles the third (and arguably weakest) entry in The Mummy franchise—<em>The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</em>—counting down all its “sins” in under 15 minutes. Along the way they hype up their main site, link out to YouTube channels (@TVSins, @CommercialSins, etc.), and invite you to join their community (Discord, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram) or support them on Patreon.</p>

<p>Want to weigh in? There’s a quick poll to tell CinemaSins what you think, plus Twitter and Instagram shout-outs for the writers (Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian, Daniel) and even a book by Jeremy for die-hard sin-seekers.</p>
