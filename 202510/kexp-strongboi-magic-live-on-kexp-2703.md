<p>strongboi dropped a killer live session of “magic” at the KEXP studio on August 14, 2025. Fronted by Alice Matthew’s soaring vocals, the band grooves hard with Ziv Yamin on keys, Dekel Adin on bass, Matthew Roth on drums, Eden Mechulam on guitar/vox and Paolo Guolo weaving in sax, flute and backing vocals.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, host Kennady Quille kept the vibes flowing while Kevin Suggs (audio engineer), David Parry (mixer) and Matt Ogaz (mastering) polished the sound. Four cameras and editor Carlos Cruz captured every moment—check out strongboi.com or KEXP.org for the full experience, and join their YouTube channel for perks.</p>
