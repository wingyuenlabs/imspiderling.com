<p>Hey Angular devs! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>The ngxsmk-datatable library just released v1.1.0, and it comes with some great updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full TypeScript type safety for rows, columns, and templates â€“ no more  runtime surprises!</li>
<li>Virtual scrolling for smooth performance with large datasets.</li>
<li>Frozen columns for better usability in wide tables.</li>
<li>Improved row selection and checkbox handling.</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s perfect if you work with large data tables in Angular and want both performance and safety.</p>
