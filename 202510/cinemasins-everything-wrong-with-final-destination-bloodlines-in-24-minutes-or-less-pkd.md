<p>CinemaSins just rolled out a 24-minute “Everything Wrong With” video for Final Destination: Bloodlines, gleefully cataloging every ridiculous death trap, continuity hiccup and head-scratcher—because hey, it’s still glorious nonsense. They even slide in a plug for BetterHelp therapy (discount link included) for anyone left traumatised by all the over-the-top carnage.</p>

<p>As usual, the CinemaSins empire is on full display: links to TVSins, CommercialSins, their podcast network, Discord, Reddit, Patreon and a “sinful” poll to gather your hottest takes. They also shout out their writer squad—Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian and Daniel—complete with Twitter and Insta handles for your stalking pleasure.</p>
