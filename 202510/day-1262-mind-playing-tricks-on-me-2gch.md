<p><em>liner notes</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Professional : Really productive day to end the week. Figured out why my code wasn't doing the thing I wanted it to. It had to do with the variable name I was passing into an SDK. Funny enough, the docs had an error and the SDK itself was using a different name for the variable. I reached out to the SDK maintainer to let them know and they are going to fix it. I was able to finish the project that is basically an interactive tutorial that people can take by spinning up a GitHub Codespace. Sent that over to the people that will then incorporate that into their work. Want to make sure I'm not the blocker. haha. Earlier this week, I ran into an issue trying to add a page to the documentation. I got that issue worked out and added the information and scheduled a message to some folks to get feedback and some answers. I even had time to respond to a question from the community Slack channel. Pretty much set up everything so that folks can get their work done because I'll be off next week.</p></li>
<li><p>Personal : Last night, I went through Bandcamp and picked up some projects. I also put together the social media posts that I posted during my lunch break today. Pretty sure I did more, but I don't remember. haha My mind's playing tricks on me. haha I know I did finish watching "Eyes of Wakanda". I liked it. Pretty good series and how it tied into the movies.</p></li>

The water is choppy with whitecaps, and the sun sets or rises between the distant peaks, casting a warm glow on the landscape. The foreground features a dark pebble beach and a piece of driftwood being washed by the waves. The setting appears to be Kathleen Lake in Kluane National Park, Yukon, Canada." width="800" height="450"></a></p>

<p>The first model I made for this prototype came out really good. I got some measurements wrong, but things fit. I have some ideas on bettering it. Going to work on modifying the model so I can print it out before heading to the station tomorrow. Before that, I'm going to put together tracks for the radio show. You can check out the radio show at <a href="https://kNOwBETTERHIPHOP.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://kNOwBETTERHIPHOP.com</a> No study sessions at <a href="https://untilit.works" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://untilit.works</a> on Sunday because I'll be judging a hackathon. Also, I'm off next week, so no updates to this blog. My plan is to work on my business. I want to wrap up these prototypes for the potential client and send it off. I want to finally clear up some more space in my workshop and set up some shelves so I finally unbox and start using these equipment that has been sitting around. I'm out! Going to eat dinner and start work for tonight. Planning to end the night watching "Marvel Zombies" since it's Halloween.</p>

<p>Have a great night and week!</p>

<p>peace piece<br>
