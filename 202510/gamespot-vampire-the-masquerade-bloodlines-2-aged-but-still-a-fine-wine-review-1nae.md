<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 isn’t exactly pushing technical boundaries—it’s a bit rough around the edges and doesn’t break the mold. But what it lacks in polish it makes up for in spades with compelling gameplay loops that keep you hooked.</p>

<p>The game’s environments are gorgeous, the story packs enough punch to keep you invested, and its cast of characters is dripping with personality. In short, it might be aged, but Bloodlines 2 still pours a damn fine vintage.</p>
