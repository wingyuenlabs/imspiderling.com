<p>Last week was packed but I couldn’t miss to register in my meetup series a entry for the <a href="https://meetu.ps/e/Ps1fy/D8QtB/i" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symfony/PHP meetup</a> hosted at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/finanztip/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finanztip’s office</a>. First because PHP is cool, second because I always meet nice friends in the PHP community.</p>

<p>I attended the first talk, “Refactor Like a Pro: Clean Code Meets DDD” with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silas-joisten" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silas Joisten</a>. I got the opportunity to revisit some refactoring concepts, plus a strategy of using assertations to avoid primitive types to achieve a more domain context mainly to DTO/Models IDs.</p>

<p>I also discovered a new tool: Rector for automated refactoring. I’m definitely planning to give it a try soon!</p>

<p>A very positive surprise was meeting so many colleagues again at the same event that was really nice! Great to see you all again <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksei-menkov/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexei</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/siegfried-diel/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siegfried</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-ribeiro-6909b25/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victor</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniele-cinquantini/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniele</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-froemer/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andreas</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leealanburton/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lee</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lotfi-aliane-68797a143/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lotfi</a></p>

<p>The second talk was “12 Rules for Better Tests” with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-feldmann-dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sebastian Feldmann</a>, but this one i lost it due other appointment. I’ll have to catch it next time. He always brings excellent topics about everyday programming and system architecture.</p>

<p>It was definitely another event worth attending.</p>

<p>See you all at the next one!</p>
