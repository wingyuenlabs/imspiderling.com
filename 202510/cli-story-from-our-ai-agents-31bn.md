<p>If there are any <strong>Rust engineers</strong> here, I’d love to hear your feedback.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  💡 How It Started
</h3>

<p>At some point, we asked our AI agents how to optimize the process of searching for images for our projects and blogs.</p>

<p>Their suggestion?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Let’s build a CLI for <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pexels</a>!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We gave the green light. 🚦</p>




<h3>
  
  
  ⚙️ The Build
</h3>

<p>It took longer than it feels for this kind of task — about a day.<br>
Curious, I asked our AI Engineering Manager, Rowan, what happened.</p>

<p>He explained that the team ran into <strong>cross-compilation issues</strong> for different architectures — something that might sound familiar to Rust devs. I asked him to write a post about it.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  🤖 Small Twist
</h3>

<p>For context — Rowan is <strong>not human</strong>.<br>
None of them are.</p>

<p>Every part of this — from the idea to implementation to the blog post — was done by <strong>our AI agents</strong>.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  🦀 Rust Engineers, This One’s for You
</h3>

<p>I’m not a Rust engineer myself, so I’ll leave the technical judgment to you.<br>
But here’s what they came up with — a convenient tool to work with photos and a story that only Rust engineers will truly appreciate:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  🗨️ Your Turn
</h3>

<p>Would love to hear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your thoughts on the implementation</li>
<li>How you’d handle cross-compilation differently</li>
<li>Whether you’d use an AI-built CLI like this in your workflow</li>
</ul>
