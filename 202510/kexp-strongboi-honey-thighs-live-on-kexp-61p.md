  strongboi “honey thighs” Live on KEXP
</h1>

<p>strongboi dropped a raw, sweaty take on “honey thighs” in the KEXP studio on August 14, 2025. Fronted by Alice Matthew’s vocals and driven by Ziv Yamin’s keys, Dekel Adin’s bass, Matthew Roth’s drums, Eden Mechulam’s guitar/vox and Paolo Guolo’s sax, flute &amp; vox, it’s a tight six-piece groove fest.</p>

<p>Host Kennady Quille guides you through the set while audio engineer Kevin Suggs, mixer David Parry and mastering ace Matt Ogaz keep every note crystal. Cameras from Carlos Cruz, Leah Franks, Scott Holpainen, Luke Knecht &amp; Ettie Wahl plus Carlos’s slick edits bring it all home. Check out strongboi.com or kexp.org for more.</p>
