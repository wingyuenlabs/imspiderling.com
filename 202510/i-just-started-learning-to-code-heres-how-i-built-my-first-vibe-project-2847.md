<p>A few months ago, I started learning to code. No bootcamp, no CS degree — just pure curiosity and late-night Googling.</p>

<p>Instead of going through 100 tutorials back-to-back, I decided to build something real. Something useful. Something that actually solved a problem I was facing.</p>

<p>That’s how my first “vibe project” was born:<br>
CandidateList.live, a site to make it easier to find election candidate lists in India.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffgndfx49ydzl1hne00s3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ffgndfx49ydzl1hne00s3.png" alt=" " width="800" height="470"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Problem I Was Facing
</h2>

<p>During an ongoing state election, I was trying to find a complete list of candidates by district and party.<br>
Turns out… that’s not as easy as it should be.</p>

<p>The data does exist — but it’s all over the place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some are in PDFs from election commissions</li>
<li>Some are posted on party websites</li>
<li>Some are shared in news articles, often without full detail</li>
<li>And most are completely unsearchable or unstructured</li>
</ul>

<p>I realized that even something as basic as “who is contesting from where” is not easy to track — unless you’re willing to spend hours digging through PDFs and spreadsheets.</p>

<p>So I thought: What if I just built the platform I wish existed?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What I Used?
</h2>

<p>This was going to be my first real project, so I kept it simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML for structure</li>
<li>CSS for layout and styling</li>
<li>JavaScript to handle table interactivity and basic scripting</li>
<li>Hosted the project using Vercel (free, fast, and beginner-friendly)</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn't use any fancy frameworks. My goal was simple: Make something useful. Make it public. Make it work.</p>

<p>The Most Challenging Part</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the hardest part wasn’t layout or styling.</p>

<p>It was building a small script that could generate live stats around the data.</p>

<p>For example: total number of candidates, how many states/parties are covered, etc.</p>

<p>Even though I was working with static files, I wanted to simulate dynamic behavior — without using a backend.</p>

<p>So I wrote a small JavaScript function that reads the data from the tables and updates the stats at the top of the page automatically.</p>

<p>Not a huge challenge for experienced devs — but for me, it felt like a big win.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What I Learned?
</h2>

<p>Solving your own problem is the best project idea. I didn’t build this because of a tutorial. I built it because I needed it.</p>

<p>You don’t need a complex stack to build something real. Even basic HTML/CSS/JS can go a long way.</p>

<p>Making things public is scary — but it’s worth it. Publishing this project (and writing about it now) feels way more exciting than finishing another tutorial.</p>

<p>Small things matter. Even simple features like auto-counting stats or table filters can improve the experience a lot.</p>

<p>What’s Next?</p>

<p>The site is live and works well for now.<br>
But there’s still so much I want to improve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add more states and parties</li>
<li>Handle live updates or versioned lists</li>
<li>Maybe even build a backend or database someday</li>
<li>Add search by candidate or constituency</li>
</ul>

<p>For now, I’m just glad I started.<br>
This was my first vibe project — and definitely not my last.</p>
