  The Alien vs Predator Series – Caravan of Garbage
</h1>

<p>This video rounds up two lively Caravan of Garbage reviews tackling the live-action Alien vs Predator films (2004’s <em>Alien vs Predator</em> and 2007’s <em>Requiem</em>), lamenting that despite years of hype from comics and games, they never quite delivered. Expect plenty of laughs, brutal honesty and pop-culture quips as the hosts dissect what went wrong.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for next week’s deep dive into the first four Predator movies, and don’t forget to follow James and Maso on Twitter, subscribe for more movie banter, and grab bonus content on bigsandwich.co!</p>
