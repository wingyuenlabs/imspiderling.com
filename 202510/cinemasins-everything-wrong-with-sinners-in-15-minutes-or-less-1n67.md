<p><strong>Everything Wrong With Sinners In 15 Minutes Or Less</strong> is CinemaSins’ cheeky Halloween special where they gleefully pick apart “one of the greatest genre movies of all time,” ticking off sins and gags in rapid-fire fashion. Expect their trademark mix of snark, pop-culture digs and playful nitpicks as they race through every quirk in under a quarter-hour.  </p>

<p>Along the way they drop links to their main site, Discord, Reddit and social channels (@TVSins, @CommercialSins, @CinemaSins, TikTok and more), invite you to fill out a sinful poll, and tee up their Patreon. Shout-outs go to writers Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian and Daniel—your friendly neighborhood sin-experts.</p>
