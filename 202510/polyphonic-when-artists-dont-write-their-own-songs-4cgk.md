<p><strong>When artists don't write their own songs</strong> kicks off with a sweet 20% off deal on Brilliant’s annual premium plan, then dives into pre-order links for Noah LeFevre’s new book <em>Century of Song</em> at Barnes &amp; Noble, Blackwells, Indie Bound, Amazon, Books-A-Million, Books Inc., and Chapters.</p>

<p>If you’re digging the Polyphonic vibe, you can keep the tunes (and deep dives) coming by supporting on Patreon, following on Twitter, or joining the Polyphonic Discord community.</p>
