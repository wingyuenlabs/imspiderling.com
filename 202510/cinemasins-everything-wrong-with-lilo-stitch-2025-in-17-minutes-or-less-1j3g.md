<h3>
  
  
  TL;DR
</h3>

<p>Cinemasins serves up a 17-minute roast of the new live-action Lilo &amp; Stitch, gleefully calling out plot holes, odd character moments, pacing hiccups and all the little “sins” that make the remake… well, remade.</p>

<p>They also drop a batch of links to their main site, spin-off YouTube channels, social media, a viewer poll and Patreon, plus shout-outs to writers Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian and Daniel and community hubs on Discord and Reddit.</p>
