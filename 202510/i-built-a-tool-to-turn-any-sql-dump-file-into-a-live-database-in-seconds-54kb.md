<p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>If you're a developer, you've probably been in this situation: a client sends you a database_dump.sql file, or you need to set up a local copy of a production database for testing.</p>

<p>The usual process is tedious:</p>

<ul>
<li>Install the correct database server (Postgres? MySQL?)</li>
<li>Create a new user and database</li>
<li>Figure out the right command-line flags to import the .sql file</li>
<li>Hope there are no version conflicts</li>
</ul>

<p>It's a frustrating 15-minute detour from the work you actually want to do.</p>

<p>I got tired of this workflow, so I built a solution right into my app, FormPipeDB.</p>

<p>It's a feature that allows you to take an entire SQL script—CREATE TABLE statements, INSERT INTO statements, and all—and turn it into a live, fully manageable database just by pasting it into a textbox.</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click "Import SQL..."</li>
<li>Paste your entire SQL script.</li>
<li>Click "Import Database."</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it. The app parses the script, creates all the tables, defines schemas, populates the data, and even builds foreign key relationships for you. You go from a static .sql file to a fully interactive database you can edit and query visually in less than a minute.</p>

<p>This has been a game-changer for my workflow, especially for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Faster Prototyping: Instantly spin up a backend from an existing schema.</li>
<li>Easy Debugging: Quickly load a snapshot of production data to test against.</li>
<li>Client Work: Set up a database for a client project without any server configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>The app is called FormPipeDB. I'm on a mission to get my first 100 paid users, so I'm running a $99 lifetime deal. I'd love for the dev.to community to check it out and give me honest feedback.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
