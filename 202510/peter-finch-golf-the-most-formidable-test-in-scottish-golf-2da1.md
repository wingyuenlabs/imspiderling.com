<p>I tackle the jaw-dropping Old Course at Trump International—arguably Scotland’s toughest golf challenge—thanks to Golfbreaks for setting up a truly once-in-a-lifetime adventure. Watch me navigate every beastly bunker, green and coastline view to see if the course lives up to its legendary reputation.</p>

<p>Planning your own golf getaway? Golfbreaks has you covered for trip planning, the Trump Old Course tour link has all the course details, and you can even snag a discount on my clothes and gear through the equipment link.</p>
