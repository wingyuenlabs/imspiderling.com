<p><strong>So, Does Bubsy 4D Scratch an Itch or Choke on a Hairball?</strong></p>

<p>Bubsy’s back in 2025 and—surprise!—this mascot-platformer revival actually nails a lot of the basics: colorful levels, fun momentum-based traversal and that goofy charm you remember. After a hands-on session, it’s clear the developers know how to make you bounce, glide and spin with style.</p>

<p>That said, it isn’t all sunshine and yarn balls. A few rough edges—occasional performance hiccups, some fiddly controls and a couple of design head-scratchers—keep Bubsy 4D from being a full-on comeback king. It’s far from perfect, but it’s definitely a worthy trip down nostalgia lane.</p>
