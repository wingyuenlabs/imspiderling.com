<p>Two years ago, I joined Dev.to with the same excitement every new dev feels — but quickly I realized that I had no direction, no project, and no clear voice.</p>

<p>I was just posting random content, sometimes copied, sometimes AI-generated, that lacked my own authentic voice.</p>

<p>My knowledge was only surface-level, and I had no real project to anchor my identity.</p>

<p><strong>That realisation hit me hard.</strong></p>

<p>I stepped away from all public platforms—including Dev.to—and made a silent promise:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I won’t post again until I have something real to share — something built with my own hands.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to become a *<em>developer *</em> who doesn’t just consume tutorials but creates meaningful tools, resources, and solutions.</p>

<p>To do that, I needed to build something from scratch.</p>

<p>That decision marked the start of an <strong>18-month journey</strong> of intense learning, building, failing, and discovering what’s truly possible when you combine <strong>coding with AI.</strong></p>

  From Basics to Building My Own Platform: <a href="https://doitwithai.tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer">doitwithai.tools</a>
</h2>

<p>When I decided to take content creation seriously, I realised I needed a home for my ideas — a website built for long-term publishing and AI-focused education.</p>

<p>But as a junior developer familiar only with the basics of React/Next.js, building a fully optimised, scalable content platform was a daunting, near-impossible task—especially without a large budget.</p>

<p>All I had was basic knowledge of React and Next.js and a determination to build something that could last.</p>

<p>That’s when I turned to my most powerful coding partner — <strong>AI.</strong> 🤖</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1a03htiwelghki7g8slz.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1a03htiwelghki7g8slz.jpg" alt="AI" width="800" height="668"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  How AI Became My Coding Co-Founder
</h2>

<p><strong>AI</strong> didn’t just help me write code — it changed how I thought about development.</p>

<p>Every time I hit a wall, AI became my debugging partner, my mentor, and my problem-solver.</p>

<p>Here are the details of how AI helped me through every phase of building <a href="https://doitwithai.tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do It With AI Tools:</a></p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4hwh9tcwm0mens1xm2jz.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4hwh9tcwm0mens1xm2jz.png" alt="Do It With AI Tools Homepage Screenshot" width="800" height="600"></a></p>

<p>🧭 1.  Niche &amp; Direction</p>

<p>AI helped me brainstorm, analyse audiences, and identify a niche where I could merge my passions — coding, SEO, and content automation.</p>

<p>🎨 2. UI &amp; Design</p>

<p>I used AI to generate UI concepts, wireframes, and even Tailwind-based components. Every layout, card, and animation was iterated with AI feedback.</p>

<p>⚙️ 3. Backend &amp; CMS</p>

<p>The site runs on Next.js with Sanity CMS. AI guided me through schema design, data modeling, and optimizing content delivery for performance.</p>

<p>🧩 4. 2-layer caching system</p>

<p>This was one of the hardest parts. I implemented a two-layer caching system:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client Side: Utilizing Memory Caching (in-memory JS objects) and IndexedDB for fast, persistent content hydration.</li>
<li>Server Side: Employing Redis via Upstash for scalable server-side data and API caching.</li>
<li>Creating a unified caching system for seamless communication between Client-Side Caching (CSC) and Server-Side Caching (SSC).</li>
<li>Implementing the stale-while-revalidate caching pattern for optimal content delivery.</li>
</ul>

<p>🚀 5. SEO &amp; Performance</p>

<p>From meta tags and schema to Core Web Vitals,  code splitting, and reusable components — AI helped me refine every detail for speed and discoverability.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftaf9bj1ai6o0rylu4sq0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ftaf9bj1ai6o0rylu4sq0.png" alt="Meta tags in Nextjs Component " width="800" height="468"></a></p>

<p>📚 6. AI Library &amp; Content</p>

<p>I created a Free AI Library with downloadable AI assets<br>
 — tools, prompts, visuals, and docs — all curated and organized with AI’s help.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8097447ocmnoqh09u2gt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8097447ocmnoqh09u2gt.png" alt="Free AI Library with downloadable AI assets at doitwithai.tools" width="800" height="415"></a></p>

<p>📝 7. Content Production</p>

<p>Even my articles, visuals, and videos were built through AI-assisted workflows, where I focused on strategy while AI accelerated creation.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faetchdv98qrdamewz98j.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faetchdv98qrdamewz98j.png" alt="blogs section of doitwithai.tools" width="800" height="413"></a></p>

<p>🌍 8. Cross-Platform Scaling</p>

<p>Beyond the website, AI also helped create content strategies to scale the website across various platforms (TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.).</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fymvq1ej3eph1zgi5a22q.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fymvq1ej3eph1zgi5a22q.png" alt="linktree of Do It With AI Tools" width="800" height="419"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Lessons Behind the Code
</h2>

<p>Each of these categories hides dozens of smaller challenges — debugging issues that kept me up at night.</p>

<p>AI didn’t remove the struggle — it made every challenge a deeper learning experience. Each bug, failed build, and late-night error became a chance to understand things that I once avoided.</p>

<p>*<em>Through this process, I stopped seeing AI as a shortcut.<br>
*</em><br>
Instead, I started seeing it as a true coding companion.</p>

  Why Dev.to is My Destination Now
</h2>

<p>After 18 months of building, learning, and experimenting, I finally feel ready to share my journey — <strong>not as a consumer, but as a contributor.</strong></p>

<p>This time, I’m here to share real, developer-focused knowledge on how <strong>AI is transforming the way we code</strong>, build, and scale.</p>

<p>I invite you to connect, challenge my workflows, and share your own experiences. </p>
