<p>Jeff Su spills the exact productivity system he’s taught to over 6,600 Googlers: a simple four-step routine that banishes info chaos and turns good intentions into habits in just two weeks.</p>

<p>At its heart is the CORE workflow—Capture everything immediately, Organize with minimal friction, Review during scheduled sessions, and Engage by blocking time to execute. It works with any tool you already use, so you ditch the memory gymnastics (and endless willpower battles) for a process that clicks on day one.</p>
