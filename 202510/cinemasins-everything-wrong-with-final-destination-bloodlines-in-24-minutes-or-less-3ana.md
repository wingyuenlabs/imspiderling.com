<p><strong>Everything Wrong With Final Destination: Bloodlines</strong> drops a rapid-fire, 24-minute breakdown of every plot hole and over-the-top death in the latest Final Destination flick, complete with CinemaSins’ patented “sins” counter and signature snark. Along the way they plug BetterHelp therapy with a discount link and remind you that, while the franchise is pure nonsense, it’s delightfully entertaining nonsense.</p>

<p>On top of the video itself, CinemaSins promotes their main site, YouTube channels (TVSins, CommercialSins, CinemaSins Podcast Network), a quick sinful poll, and Patreon to support the team. You’ll also get a shout-out to their writers (Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian, Daniel) and links to Discord, Reddit, Jeremy’s book, Instagram, TikTok, and other social handles.</p>
