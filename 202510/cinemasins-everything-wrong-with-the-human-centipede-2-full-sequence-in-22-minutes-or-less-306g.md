<p>CinemaSins just unleashed a new “Everything Wrong With The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) In 22 Minutes Or Less” video—brace yourself, it’s apparently even grosser than you’d dare imagine. They’re planning to stitch it together with their first centipede teardown, so expect double the cringe and double the sins.</p>

<p>Of course, they’ve littered the description with all their usual goodies: links to their main site, social channels (YouTube, Discord, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok), a sinful poll, and a plea for Patreon love. Plus, they give shout-outs to their writing squad—Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian, and Daniel—so you know it’s a group effort of pure film-sinning chaos.</p>
