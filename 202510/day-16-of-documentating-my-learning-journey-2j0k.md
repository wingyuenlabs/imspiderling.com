<p><strong>What I learnt Today</strong></p>

<p>1.Learnt while loops and how to impliment them.</p>

<p><strong>On what I Learnt</strong></p>

<p>While loops are a bit different from for loops as one has to create an initializer.</p>

<p>And in a while loop the condition at 1st has to be true so it can print a certain statement.</p>

<p>Also in a while loop it can be used when we don't know the number of times we want to iterate.</p>

<p>At the end we have to specify if we want to increment or decrement depending on what we want to achieve.</p>

<p>We apply incrementation or decrementation by reassigning the varible. </p>

<p>Syntax for a while-loop:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Count =0<br>
while condition:<br>
Do sth<br>
Count += 1 or Count -= 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Count =0 is the initalizer<br>
Count +=1 is reassigning the variable.</p>

<p>I wrote a python script that prints even numbers between 1 and 20 </p>

<p><strong>Resources I used</strong></p>

<p>A python refresher series by Bonaventure Ogeto</p>

<p>Github for documentating my learning journey in python.</p>

<p><strong>What's Next</strong></p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll learn how to impliment break and continue statements </p>
