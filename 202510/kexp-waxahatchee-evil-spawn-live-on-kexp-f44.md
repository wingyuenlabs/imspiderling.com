  Waxahatchee Rocks KEXP with “Evil Spawn” Live
</h2>

<p>On August 11, 2025, Katie Crutchfield and her bandmates—Eliana Athayde, Liam Kazar, Colin Croom, Spencer Tweedy and Cole Berggren—took over KEXP’s studio for a spirited live performance of “Evil Spawn.” Host Cheryl Waters guided the session while audio engineers Julian Martlew and Charles Glanders captured every gritty riff and soaring vocal.  </p>

<p>Behind the scenes, cameras from Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen, Luke Knecht and Kendall Rock rolled as editor Luke Knecht wove the footage together. For more live goodness, head to KEXP.org or explore Waxahatchee’s latest tunes on Bandcamp.</p>
