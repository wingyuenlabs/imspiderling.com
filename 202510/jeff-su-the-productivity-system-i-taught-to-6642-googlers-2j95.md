<p>In this post, Jeff Su breaks down the CORE workflow he taught to over 6,600 Googlers in nine years: Capture everything immediately, Organize with minimal friction, Review during scheduled sessions, and Engage by blocking time to execute. It works with any tool you already use and becomes automatic within two weeksâ€”no more relying on willpower or memory alone!</p>

<p>He also drops handy timestamps (00:28 for the basics, 01:05 for CORE in action, 04:10 for a deep dive) and loads of resources: newsletter, templates, the Workspace Academy course, and his favorite gear. Perfect if you want a plug-and-play productivity boost.</p>
