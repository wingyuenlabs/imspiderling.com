  Everything Wrong With M3GAN 2.0 In 25 Minutes Or Less
</h1>

<p>CinemaSins dives into M3GAN 2.0 with their trademark nitpicks… and comes away calling it pretty boring. Expect a rapid-fire rundown of every plot hole, questionable choice and awkward CGI moment in under half an hour.</p>

<p>Besides the main video, they’re hustling their flagship site, Patreon, a reader poll and a suite of socials (YouTube spinoffs, Discord, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok) plus a shout-out to the CinemaSins writing team. If you’re a fan of over-the-top film takedowns (and don’t mind the self-promo), there’s plenty to click.</p>
