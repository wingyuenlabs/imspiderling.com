<p><strong>Listening to the Spotify Top 10 So You Don’t Have To</strong><br><br>
Rick Beato jumps into Spotify’s Global Top 50 and counts down the top 10 tracks—mostly scratching his head and asking, “What is this?” as he reacts to the playlist everyone else seems to be loving.</p>

<p>He also plugs his $50 Ear Training Sale (complete method available on his site) and wraps up by thanking a hefty roster of Beato Club supporters who keep the show going.</p>
