<p><strong>Everything Wrong With M3GAN 2.0 In 25 Minutes Or Less</strong><br><br>
CinemaSins tears into the sequel, calling out every plot hole, cringe-worthy moment, and flat scare that makes M3GAN 2.0 a total snoozefest compared to the original. Their trademark 25-minute roast covers it all—because if you’re going to rip on a killer doll, do it in style.</p>

<p>Of course, they’re also busy plugging their empire: hit up cinemasins.com, subscribe to TVSins, CommercialSins, and the CinemaSins Podcast Network on YouTube, throw in your two cents via their poll, or support the squad on Patreon. And don’t forget to stalk the writers and join the party on Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Instagram, and TikTok!</p>
