  Silvana Estrada’s Bittersweet Tiny Desk Debut
</h2>

<p>Veracruz-born Silvana Estrada brings that son jarocho spirit and ocean-deep emotion to her Tiny Desk performance, trading concert halls for an intimate setting with just her voice, a cuatro venezolano and a handful of musicians. Over the course of four songs—including the haunting “Como un Pájaro” and the hopeful “Good Luck, Good Night”—she weaves pain and beauty into something you can’t help but feel.</p>

  Vendrán Suaves Lluvias: Heartfelt and Honest
</h2>

<p>Drawn from her latest album, Vendrán Suaves Lluvias, Estrada’s Tiny Desk set captures the grief of losing a friend and the strength it takes to heal. With a stellar cast—piano, cello da spalla, euphonium, trumpet and more—she bends her wounds into hope, proving that sometimes the smallest stages hold the biggest moments.</p>
