  Is There Anything Bumblefoot Can’t Play? …No!
</h3>

<p>In this laid-back chat, Ron “Bumblefoot” Thal walks us through his wildly varied guitar career, from his early days blazing trails in hard rock to the eclectic solo projects he’s known for today. He digs into the nuts and bolts of his playing style—riff-building, mind-bending techniques and gear choices that keep him ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>Beyond the licks and layers, Ron also gives us a peek at what he’s working on now and sends a big thanks to his Beato Club supporters for making it all possible.</p>
