  My Thoughts on Rush’s NEW Drummer
</h1>

<p>In this episode I dive into Rush’s huge announcement about their new drummer—sharing my first impressions, linking to the official reveal video, and pointing you toward Anika Nilles’s Instagram for some serious drumming inspiration.</p>

<p>Big thanks to my Beato Club supporters—Justin Scott, Terence Mark, Jason Murray, Lucienne Kilpatrick, Alexander Young, Jason Wagner and the rest of the crew—for keeping these deep dives rolling!</p>
