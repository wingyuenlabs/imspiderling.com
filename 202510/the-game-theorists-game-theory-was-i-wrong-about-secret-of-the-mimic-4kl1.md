  Game Theory: Was I WRONG About Secret of the Mimic?
</h1>

<p>MatPat dives back into Five Nights at Freddy’s: Secret of the Mimic after spending months combing over every frame, only to find two rival theories that might just outsmart his own. In this episode, he pits his detective work against other top FNAF sleuths to see whose take on the game’s mysteries holds up—and whether he needs to rewrite his whole theory.</p>

<p>Plus, don’t miss a shout-out to the upcoming Creators in Fashion 2025 stream on Style Theory, and meet the creative team (shout-outs to Tom Robinson, Tyler Mascola, Axellent, Marc Schneider, Yosi Berman and Alena Lecorchick). If you’re into lore, puzzles, and a pinch of friendly debate, buckle up for some serious game-theory face-offs.</p>
