  Can We Beat the US Junior Champion?
</h1>

<p>Bryan Bros Golf just dropped a fresh vid where they take on the US Junior Champion on the course—talk about next-level competition! Their hype is through the roof (“What a day!”), and they’re stoked to share every swing, putt, and friendly banter.</p>

<p>They’ve also scattered all their go-to gear and hookup links: sign up for The Bryan Brief newsletter, join their Discord and Twitch streams, then load up on Rhoback, Foresight Sports launch monitors, Bushnell rangefinders, LAB Putters, Takomo clubs and Bruce Bolt Gloves (complete with discount codes, of course). Follow them on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for even more golf shenanigans!</p>
