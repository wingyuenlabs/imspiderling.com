<h1>
  
  
  TL;DR
</h1>

<p>CinemaSins just dropped a mega “Everything Wrong With Every Saw Movie EVER” video, stacking up every nitpick, plot hole, and forehead-slapping moment from the entire Saw franchise. Hosted by the usual crew (Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian and Daniel), it’s classic CinemaSins humor: sharp, snarky and relentless.</p>

<p>They’re also pushing you to dive deeper into the CinemaSins universe—hit up their site, subscribe to spin-off channels (@TVSins, @commercialsins, @cinemasinspodcastnetwork), fill out their sinful poll, back them on Patreon, or join the chaos on Discord, Reddit, Instagram and TikTok.</p>
