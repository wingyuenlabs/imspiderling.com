<p>Ezra Furman rocked the KEXP studio on August 13, 2025, with a live rendition of “Submission.” Backed by Liz Furman (vocals, guitar), Ben Joseph (keys, guitar), Sam Durkes (drums), Jorgen Jorgensen (bass) and Lilah Larson (guitar), the performance crackles with raw energy and tight musicianship.</p>

<p>Host Cheryl Waters guides the session while Kevin Suggs and Matt Ogaz handle audio engineering and mastering. Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen, Luke Knecht and Ettie Wahl man the cameras and Carlos Cruz stitches it all together in the edit.
