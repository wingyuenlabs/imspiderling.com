<p>Hey everyone 👋  </p>

<p>I’m excited to introduce <strong>AlgoSync</strong> — a new social media platform built <strong>for developers, founders, and tech creators</strong>.</p>

<p>AlgoSync is where tech people share what they’re building, exchange ideas, open discussion, and connect with others in the industry — all in a clean, dev-focused environment.</p>

<p>We officially launched just a few days ago, and the response has been amazing:<br><br>
🚀 <strong>40+ daily active users</strong> in the first 4–5 days<br><br>
🎓 Developers and top students from schools like <strong>Stanford, Berkeley, and Waterloo</strong> have already joined<br><br>
🌍 Growing purely through word of mouth  </p>

<p>AlgoSync is now live (web only for now, mobile responsive).<br><br>
Come join the early community and be part of the conversation 👇  </p>
