<p>Season 1 of skate.™ Early Access is live, and it’s completely free to drop in on PS4/PS5, Xbox One/Series X|S or PC.

<p>Just remember you’ll need a persistent internet connection, the latest game update, an EA account (plus any platform subscriptions) and you might want to be old enough to handle those optional in-game purchases. Enjoy the ride!</p>
