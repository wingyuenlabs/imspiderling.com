<p>Rick Shiels, James Robinson and Guy Charnock tackle an 18-hole “Yellow Ball” challenge with one shared goal—break 75. Before every hole, someone draws a ball from the bag: pull the yellow ball and you’re on your own, no help allowed. Cue huge momentum swings, nerve-wracking solo stints, epic saves, total meltdowns and plenty of cheeky banter as they battle pressure golf at its finest.</p>

<p>When they’re not chasing pars, Rick invites you to subscribe to LIV Golf, snag his limited-edition merch (UK/US links), and dive into his podcast and gear-review channel. He’s all about helping you crush longer drives, dial in your irons, master chipping and putting, and generally play better golf.</p>
