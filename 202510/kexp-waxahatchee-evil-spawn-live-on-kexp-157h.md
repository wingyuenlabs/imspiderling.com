<p>Waxahatchee took over KEXP’s studio on August 11, 2025, for a gritty live rendition of “Evil Spawn.” Katie Crutchfield fronted the six-piece lineup—Eliana Athayde on bass, Liam Kazar on guitar, Colin Croom on pedal steel, Spencer Tweedy on drums and Cole Berggren adding keys and banjo—for a stripped-down, electrifying performance.</p>

<p>Host Cheryl Waters guided the session while engineers Julian Martlew and Charles Glanders handled audio, with Matt Ogaz mastering. A five-camera crew led by Jim Beckmann captured every moment—catch the full set on KEXP or stream Waxahatchee at their Bandcamp.</p>
