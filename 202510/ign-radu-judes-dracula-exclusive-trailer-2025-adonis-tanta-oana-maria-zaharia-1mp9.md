<p>Radu Jude’s Dracula trailer teases a wild genre-mash where a curious young filmmaker pushes a fake A.I. to spin the original Dracula myth into everything from vampire hunts and zombie mayhem to sci-fi epics, tragic romances, kitschy folktales and even Dracula crashing a workers’ strike.</p>

<p>Featuring a stellar Romanian cast including Adonis Tanța, Oana Maria Zaharia, Gabriel Spahiu, Ilinca Manolache and more, this 2025 flick is written and directed by Radu Jude—and promises a fresh, irreverent spin on Vlad the Impaler’s legacy.</p>
