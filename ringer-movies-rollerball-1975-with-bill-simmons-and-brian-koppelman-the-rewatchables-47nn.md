  Rewatching Rollerball (1975) with Bill Simmons &amp; Brian Koppelman
</h2>

<p>Bill Simmons and Brian Koppelman go full-throttle on Norman Jewison’s cult classic Rollerball, starring James Caan, John Houseman, and John Beck. In their first rule-free Rewatchables podcast, they unpack why this high-octane thriller doubles as a sports movie, debate the most rewatchable scene, and run through their signature categories.</p>

<p>Produced by Craig Horlbeck and Ronak Nair, the episode features a cold open, timestamped highlights (from the paranoid-thriller breakdown at 2:33 to the category awards at 56:36), and a reminder that Rollerball is streaming on Prime—plus all the ways to subscribe, shop merch, and connect with The Ringer.</p>
