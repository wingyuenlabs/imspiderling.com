<p>During job searches, I found myself juggling spreadsheets, notes, and emails just to keep track of applications and interviews. It was messy and easy to lose context.</p>

<p>So I built TrackInterview.</p>

<p>👉 <a href="https://trackinterview.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://trackinterview.com/</a></p>

<p><strong>TrackInterview</strong> is a simple tool focused only on one thing:<br>
helping you track job applications and interviews in one place.</p>

<p>No job listings.<br>
No preparation content.<br>
Just tracking—who you applied to, what stage you’re in, and what happened next.</p>

<p>It’s built with a focus on simplicity, offline-first usage, and real-world job hunting workflows.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever lost track of an interview or follow-up, this might help.<br>
Feedback is welcome.</p>
