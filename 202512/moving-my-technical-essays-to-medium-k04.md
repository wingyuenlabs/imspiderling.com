<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>After a great run sharing tutorials, tips, and lessons on dev.to, I’m shifting my long-form technical writing to Medium.</p>

<p>Why Medium? I want to explore deeper dives into Bitcoin infrastructure, Lightning Network operations, custody security, and high-scale system engineering—topics that benefit from longer narratives, detailed diagrams, and real-world lessons from production.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed my posts here, you’ll find the Medium articles even more in-depth, practical, and actionable. I’ll continue sharing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lessons from running Bitcoin Lightning nodes in production</p></li>
<li><p>Strategies for building scarce, high-value skills in infrastructure and security</p></li>
<li><p>Hands-on guides for Rust, cryptography, and distributed systems</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can follow me on Medium here: <a href="https://medium.com/@jackhoudini" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wartime Engineer</a></p>

<p>Thank you to the dev.to community for all the engagement and feedback—it’s been invaluable. I hope to see you over on Medium for the next chapter.</p>

<p>— Chinonso</p>
