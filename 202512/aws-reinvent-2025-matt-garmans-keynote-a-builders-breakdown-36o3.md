<p>Day 1 at AWS re:Invent 2025 kicked off with Matt Garman’s first keynote as CEO of AWS — and the message was unmistakable:</p>

<p><strong>This is the AI era, and AWS is building the full stack for it.</strong></p>

<p>Matt structured the entire keynote around four core areas:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>AI Infrastructure</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inference Platform</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your Data</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tools to Build Agents</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>And what I loved most: after each major section, AWS brought customers on stage to share <em>real implementations</em> — not just theory.</p>

<p>Sony, Adobe, and Writer all walked through how they’re building on top of these new capabilities, grounding the announcements in reality.</p>

<p>Here’s my full breakdown.</p>




<h1>
  
  
  <strong>1. AI Infrastructure: The Foundation for What Comes Next</strong>
</h1>

<p>Matt opened with a thoughtful shoutout to <strong>AWS Heroes, Community Builders, and User Group Leaders</strong>, calling them the builders shaping the future. As someone involved deeply in community, that meant a lot.</p>

<p>Then came the infrastructure announcements — big ones.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>🔹 AWS AI Factories</strong>
</h3>

<p>A new end-to-end framework to scale AI development and deployment. Think of it as the production line for enterprise-grade AI: data → training → eval → deploy.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>🔹 Trn3 Ultra Server + the tease of Trn4</strong>
</h3>

<p>AWS rarely brings hardware on stage… but today they did.</p>

<p>Seeing the <strong>Trn3 Ultra server physically on the keynote floor</strong> made a statement about how seriously AWS is doubling down on custom silicon.</p>

<p>Trn4 previews promise even bigger gains for large-scale training.</p>

<p><em>(No customer segment here — this section was pure infrastructure.)</em></p>




<h1>
  
  
  <strong>2. Inference Platform: Bedrock Gets Even Bigger</strong>
</h1>

<p>Inference is where most real-world workloads live, so this segment was packed.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>🔹 New models coming to Amazon Bedrock:</strong>
</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gemma</strong></li>
<li><strong>Qwen</strong></li>
<li><strong>NVIDIA models</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mistral</strong></li>
<li>And several domain-specialized models</li>
</ul>

<p>AWS is clearly pushing for breadth and choice.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>🔹 Nova 2 – Sonic, Lite, Pro + Nova 2 Omni</strong>
</h3>

<p>The next-gen Nova models bring stronger multimodal reasoning, faster inference, and improved efficiency.</p>

<p><em>(This section didn’t have customer stories either — announcements only.)</em></p>




<h1>
  
  
  <strong>3. Your Data: Introducing Nova Forge — With Sony On Stage</strong>
</h1>

<p>This was one of the most quietly important announcements, and it got even better when <strong>Sony</strong> took the stage to show how they’re using it.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>🔹 Nova Forge</strong>
</h3>

<p>A new way to standardize, transform, and prepare data specifically for AI workflows — which solves one of the biggest bottlenecks for enterprise teams.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>🔹 Sony’s Use Case</strong>
</h3>

<p>Sony showcased how they’re using Nova Forge to power large-scale media, entertainment, and interactive experiences.</p>

<p>They highlighted how data consistency and transformation pipelines directly influence model quality — a real, practical viewpoint that grounded the announcement.</p>

<p>This was one of the most relatable customer segments of the keynote.</p>




<h1>
  
  
  <strong>4. Tools to Build Agents: Adobe &amp; Writer Take the Stage</strong>
</h1>

<p>This was arguably the most future-facing part of the keynote — AWS clearly sees agents as the <em>new way</em> apps will be built.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>🔹 AgentCore Updates</strong>
</h3>

<p>Two major capabilities were introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Policy in AgentCore</strong> — fine-grained control and governance for agent behavior</li>
<li>
<strong>Evaluations in AgentCore</strong> — structured ways to measure, test, and improve agent performance</li>
</ul>

<p>These are foundational pieces for scaling agent-based applications responsibly.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>🔹 New Frontier Agents</strong>
</h3>

<p>AWS previewed a lineup of advanced agents:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Kiro</strong> — autonomous decision-making</li>
<li>
<strong>Security Agent</strong> — automated detection + remediation</li>
<li>
<strong>DevOps Agent</strong> — supports deployments, debugging, and operations</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>🔹 Adobe’s Use Case</strong>
</h3>

<p>Adobe demonstrated how they’re leveraging agent tooling to build more powerful creative workflows — with governance and responsible AI at the center.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>🔹 Writer’s Use Case</strong>
</h3>

<p>Writer showed how they’re using agents to create enterprise-grade copilots — emphasizing repeatability, safety, and domain-specific knowledge.</p>

<p>Seeing both Adobe and Writer focus on agent-based systems reinforced AWS’s belief that agents will be the next layer of application logic.</p>




<h1>
  
  
  <strong>Modernizing the Old: Amazon Transform Custom</strong>
</h1>

<p>AI wasn’t the only focus.</p>

<p>Matt also announced <strong>Amazon Transform Custom</strong>, a tool built to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Modernize legacy code</li>
<li>Upgrade versions</li>
<li>Refactor old systems</li>
<li>Accelerate modernization projects</li>
</ul>

<p>This solves problems every enterprise has but rarely talks about publicly.</p>




<h1>
  
  
  <strong>And in the Last 10 Minutes… All the Non-AI Announcements</strong>
</h1>

<p>Just when everyone assumed the keynote was 100% AI, Matt switched gears and rapid-fired a long list of non-AI updates:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lambda Durable Functions</strong></li>
<li><strong>S3 bucket size increases</strong></li>
<li><strong>S3 Intelligent Tiering for vector workloads</strong></li>
<li><strong>S3 Access Point for NetApp ONTAP</strong></li>
<li><strong>Security Hub updates</strong></li>
<li><strong>GuardDuty enhancements</strong></li>
<li><strong>CloudWatch Unified Data Store</strong></li>
<li>And the crowd favorite: <strong>Database Savings Plans</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A good reminder that AWS is still building across the entire cloud stack — not just AI.</p>




<h1>
  
  
  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>
</h1>

<p>This keynote was crisp, focused, and surprisingly grounded in customer reality.</p>

<p><strong>AWS isn’t just shipping models.<br>
They’re building silicon → infra → data → agents → use cases — end to end.</strong></p>

<p>Sony, Adobe, and Writer brought those layers to life with practical examples.</p>
