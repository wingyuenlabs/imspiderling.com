<p>I save a lot of good content. LinkedIn posts, X threads, Reddit insights.<br>
but when I actually need them… they’re gone.</p>

<p>Bookmarks became a black hole.</p>

<p>so I started building <a href="//lynkbin.vercel.app">LynkBin</a></p>

<p>a simple place to dump everything you save and actually find it later.</p>

<p>what it does:</p>

<ul>
<li>one hub for saved posts + personal notes</li>
<li>AI auto organizes stuff (categories, tags, short descriptions based on the content)</li>
<li>smart filters so you don’t have to scroll forever</li>
<li>save in seconds via <strong>Dashboard or Telegram bot</strong>
**</li>
</ul>

<p>the goal isn’t to save more content. it’s to make saved content useful again.</p>

<p>I’m actively adding more features including support for more platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and will also work on browser extension to save things even faster.</p>

<p>I'm open to ideas on what would make this useful and super easy for you to use.</p>
