<p>SpillTea is a next-generation anonymous confessions platform that creates a safe space for people to share their thoughts, secrets, and stories without revealing their identity. Whether you need to vent, seek advice, share a win, or just spill the tea on something that's been bothering you, SpillTea provides a judgment-free zone for authentic self-expression.</p>

<p>The Problem We Solve:</p>

<p>In today's hyper-connected social media landscape, everything is tied to your real identity. People self-censor, curate perfect personas, and hide their authentic thoughts out of fear of judgment. SpillTea brings back the raw, unfiltered honesty of early internet forums and platforms like PostSecret, but with modern UX and gamification that keeps users engaged.</p>

<p>How It Works:</p>

<p>Sign in anonymously - No email, no phone number, just instant anonymous Firebase authentication<br>
Get a fun name - Receive a randomly generated anonymous identity (e.g., "Cosmic Panda," "Neon Butterfly")<br>
Spill the tea - Share your confession in 500 characters or less<br>
Choose burn mode - Make it disappear after 100 views for extra secrecy<br>
Build your streak - Post daily to build streaks and earn exclusive badges<br>
Earn karma - Get reactions on your confessions to climb the leaderboard<br>
Engage safely - React, reply, share, and listen via text-to-speech<br>

Accessibility: Built-in text-to-speech for audio playback of confessions<br>
Beautiful UX: Modern dark theme with gradient accents and micro-animations<br>
