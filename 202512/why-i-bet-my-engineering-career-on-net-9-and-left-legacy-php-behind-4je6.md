<p>When I started my journey in software engineering, I spent a lot of time in the trenches of legacy web development. I maintained spaghetti PHP codebases, patched SQL injection vulnerabilities in systems used by thousands of students, and wrestled with the chaos of loosely typed languages.</p>

<p>It was a necessary education. But it wasn’t the future.</p>

<p>Today, as a <strong>Software Engineer based in Verona</strong>, I have pivoted entirely to the <strong>Microsoft Stack (.NET 9)</strong>. Here is why I believe C# and Blazor are the only viable choice for building secure, scalable enterprise systems in 2025.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  1. Type Safety is Not Optional
</h3>

<p>In my early days of building automation scripts and web tools, “undefined is not a function” was a daily nightmare. In the enterprise world—where I now focus on CRM architecture—you cannot afford runtime errors.</p>

<p>C# gives me the strictness I need. If the code compiles, it (mostly) works. The transition from legacy PHP to strongly typed C# changed the way I think about data. I don’t just move JSON around; I define <strong>Models</strong>, <strong>Contracts</strong>, and <strong>Interfaces</strong>. This makes the software predictable and secure by design.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  2. The Blazor Revolution
</h3>

<p>For years, “Full Stack” meant context-switching between a backend language (Python/Java) and a frontend framework (React/Angular).</p>

<p>With <strong>Blazor WebAssembly</strong>, I write C# on the server and C# in the browser.<br>
I share my DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and validation logic across the entire stack. This cuts development time in half and eliminates the “API drift” that kills so many projects.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  3. Performance is King
</h3>

<p>I come from a background of <strong>low-level automation</strong> and <strong>WinAPI</strong> optimization. I care about milliseconds.<br>
Modern .NET 9 is absurdly fast. With AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation, C# now rivals C++ and Rust in many benchmarks. For the high-availability CRM systems I architect, this performance is non-negotiable.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h3>

<p>There is a reason enterprise companies in Northern Italy (and the world) run on .NET. It is stable, it is fast, and it is mature.<br>
I am proud to be a <strong>.NET Specialist</strong>. I don’t chase the JavaScript framework of the week. I build systems that last.</p>
