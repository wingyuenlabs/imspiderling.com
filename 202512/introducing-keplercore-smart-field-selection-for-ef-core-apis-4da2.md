<p>I built a EF Core extension that lets you improve your performance and only select what you want.</p>

<p>Filter props with any type you want (Contains, StartsWith, Equals, etc.)</p>

<p>You can exclude sensitive fields with attributes or fluent API, and if needed you can ignore them all by setting IgnoreGlobalExceptions = true when applying the policy.</p>

<p>Also you can see the full lambda expression and generated SQL the nuget creates so no black box.</p>

<p>Helper to see full global excludes, filters, order by fields, or props you have selected.</p>

<p>All you need to do is create the policy and define it in program and you're done.</p>

<p>You can have multiple policy names per your models and tables.</p>

<p>Also if you want to check the nuget you can check these links:<br>
