<p>I've watched marketers spend $20 on ChatGPT Plus, type "write me a blog post about SEO," get 500 words of generic fluff, then declare AI "doesn't work for content."</p>

<p>The problem isn't the AI. It's the prompt.</p>

<p>After a year of testing every major AI platform for content creation, here's what I've learned: the difference between garbage output and genuinely useful content briefs comes down to how you talk to these systems. And most marketers are doing it wrong.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why Your Current Prompts Are Failing
</h2>

<p>Let's start with what doesn't work. I see these patterns everywhere:</p>

<p><strong>The Vague Ask:</strong> "Write content about digital marketing trends."</p>

<p><strong>The Kitchen Sink:</strong> "Write a blog post about SEO that's engaging, informative, optimized, shareable, and converts readers into customers."</p>

<p><strong>The Copy-Paste Special:</strong> Using the same prompt template for every piece of content.</p>

<p>Here's the thing about AI models like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet—they're prediction engines trained on the entire internet. When you give them a generic prompt, they give you the most statistically average response possible. Which is exactly what you don't want.</p>

<p>You want specific. You want distinctive. You want something that sounds like your brand, not like every other marketing blog that exists.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Anatomy of Prompts That Actually Work
</h2>

<p>Good prompts have four components:</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Who you are, what you're creating, and why<br>
<strong>Constraints:</strong> Specific limitations that force creativity<br>
<strong>Examples:</strong> Show don't tell what you want<br>
<strong>Output Structure:</strong> Exactly how you want the response formatted</p>

<p>Let me show you the difference.</p>

<p><strong>Bad prompt:</strong><br>
"Write a content brief for a blog post about email marketing."</p>

<p><strong>Good prompt:</strong><br>
"I'm a content manager at a B2B SaaS company (project management software) writing for marketing directors at 50-500 person companies. Create a content brief for a 1,500-word blog post about email marketing automation that addresses the specific pain point of managing lead nurture sequences when you have limited time and budget. The brief should include: headline options, key sections with specific angles, 3 real company examples to research, and 5 semantic SEO keywords beyond 'email marketing automation.' Tone should be practical and slightly skeptical of overhyped tactics."</p>

<p>See the difference? The second prompt gives the AI enough constraints to avoid generic responses.</p>
<h2>
  
  
  Platform-Specific Techniques: ChatGPT vs Claude
</h2>

<p>I've run the same prompts through both platforms extensively. They have different strengths.</p>

<p><strong>ChatGPT (GPT-4) excels at:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Structured outputs with specific formatting</li>
<li>Following complex multi-step instructions</li>
<li>Generating variations and iterations quickly</li>
<li>Understanding marketing frameworks and terminology</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Claude 3.5 Sonnet excels at:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Nuanced tone and voice matching</li>
<li>Longer, more coherent content briefs</li>
<li>Better at avoiding marketing jargon when you ask for it</li>
<li>More conservative with claims (won't promise "10x growth" nonsense)</li>
</ul>

<p>For content briefs specifically, I prefer Claude for initial creation and ChatGPT for refinement and variations.</p>
<h2>
  
  
  The Content Brief Framework That Works
</h2>

<p>Here's the prompt structure I use for content briefs. It's worked across dozens of clients and content types:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Role: [Your specific role and company context]
Audience: [Specific persona with pain points]
Content Goal: [One primary objective]
Content Type: [Format, length, platform]
Constraints: [What to avoid, limitations, requirements]
Tone: [2-3 specific descriptors with examples]
Output: [Exact structure you want]
Examples: [1-2 similar pieces that worked]
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Let me walk through a real example I used last month:</p>

<p><strong>Role:</strong> Content strategist at a marketing agency serving e-commerce brands doing $1M-10M annually</p>

<p><strong>Audience:</strong> E-commerce marketing managers who are overwhelmed by the number of available marketing channels and struggling to prioritize where to spend limited budgets</p>

<p><strong>Content Goal:</strong> Help readers create a simple framework for channel prioritization that they can implement this quarter</p>

<p><strong>Content Type:</strong> 2,000-word guide with actionable framework</p>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong> No generic advice ("test everything"), no tactics requiring enterprise-level budgets, must include specific tools under $200/month</p>

<p><strong>Tone:</strong> Practical and direct, like a senior marketer mentoring a junior colleague. Acknowledge the complexity without being overwhelming.</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> Content brief with headline options, 6-8 main sections, 3 case study suggestions, keyword list, and internal linking opportunities</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong> [Links to two similar pieces that performed well]</p>

<p>The result? A 400-word content brief that my writer used to create one of our best-performing pieces of Q3.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Advanced Prompt Engineering Tricks
</h2>

<p><strong>Use Negative Prompting</strong><br>
Tell the AI what NOT to include. "Don't use generic phrases like 'game-changer' or 'revolutionary.' Don't promise unrealistic results. Don't include tactics that require a $50K+ budget."</p>

<p><strong>Chain Your Prompts</strong><br>
Don't try to get everything in one response. Start with a basic brief, then refine: "Now add 3 specific data points I should research to support each main section."</p>

<p><strong>Give It Constraints That Force Creativity</strong><br>
"Write this brief as if the reader has exactly 30 minutes to implement the main tactic" or "Assume the reader has tried and failed at this before."</p>

<p><strong>Use the 'Perspective Shift' Technique</strong><br>
"Write this brief from the perspective of a marketing director who's skeptical of new tactics" or "Approach this as if you're explaining to someone who's been burned by bad advice before."</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Common Mistakes That Kill Your Results
</h2>

<p>Even with good prompt structure, I see marketers sabotage themselves:</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 1: Not Iterating</strong><br>
Your first prompt won't be perfect. Good content briefs come from 2-3 rounds of refinement.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 2: Forgetting Context</strong><br>
AI doesn't remember what you told it yesterday. Include relevant context in every prompt.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 3: Asking for Everything at Once</strong><br>
Better to get a solid brief first, then ask for headline variations, then keyword suggestions. Break it down.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 4: Not Testing Different Approaches</strong><br>
The same prompt can yield different results depending on how you frame it. Try multiple angles.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Making AI Content Briefs Actually Useful
</h2>

<p>Here's what separates content briefs that sit in Google Docs forever from ones that become great content:</p>

<p><strong>Specificity Over Comprehensiveness</strong><br>
Better to have 3 specific, actionable sections than 8 generic ones.</p>

<p><strong>Research Hooks</strong><br>
Good briefs don't just outline content—they tell you exactly what to research. "Interview 2-3 customers who've struggled with this" is more valuable than "include customer examples."</p>

<p><strong>Built-in Differentiation</strong><br>
Every brief should answer: "How is this different from the 47 other articles on this topic?" If your AI can't answer that, refine your prompt.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Reality Check
</h2>

<p>Look, AI won't replace good marketing judgment. It won't magically know your brand voice without examples. And it definitely won't turn bad strategy into good content.</p>

<p>But when used correctly, it can turn a 2-hour brief-writing process into a 20-minute one. And the quality? Often better than what most of us were creating manually.</p>

<p>The key is treating AI like a very smart intern who needs clear direction, not like a magic content machine.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What's Next
</h2>

<p>Start with one piece of content. Use the framework above. Iterate until you get something you'd actually want to write from.</p>

<p>Then do it again. The prompts that work for your brand and audience are different from mine. But the structure—context, constraints, examples, output format—that's universal.</p>

<p>And remember: the goal isn't to eliminate human creativity. It's to spend less time on the scaffolding and more time on the insights that matter.</p>

<p>Because at the end of the day, even the best AI prompt can't replace knowing your audience well enough to solve their actual problems.</p>
