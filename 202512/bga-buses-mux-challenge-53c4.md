<p>At the moment, the project has only the integration with the Google APIs, </p>

</p>

<p>And I working hard to publish the first version.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Story Behind It
</h2>

<p>One year ago I moved from the city of Medellín, to Bucaramanga, Colombia.<br>
I found a difference in the transportation quality and my first thought was to find a way to help me understand the routes of the buses.<br>
I always liked to help others so I fused both things, and being honest, it excites me.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Technical Highlights
</h2>

<p>As the MVP is the priority, next are the services required to run it:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Hosting
</h3>

<p>For fast publication and with zero cost I choose <code>Github Pages</code></p>

<h4>
  
  
  Algorithms
</h4>

<p>And as data structures are tied to algorithms and the reverse is also true, for now, I would host all the public data (format to be defined) of the buses routes in the repository and fetch them at demand.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Maps, Routes, AutoComplete API
</h3>

<p>Using the maps services of Google becomes important as they are fast to integrate and to use with zero backend.</p>

<p>For later, the idea is to allow the administrators of the transportation companies to be able to update the routes, see metrics and make public announcements (This is the selling stage).</p>
