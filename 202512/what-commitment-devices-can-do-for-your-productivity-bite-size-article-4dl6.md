  Introduction
</h1>

<p>A commitment device is a mechanism for "blocking your escape routes in advance so your future self won't slack off."</p>

<p>No matter how important a task or project may be, we sometimes find ourselves picking up our phone or drifting into unproductive habits, postponing what needs to be done. This isn't a matter of weak willpower or lack of discipline. Humans are naturally wired to behave this way.</p>

<p>That’s exactly why relying only on willpower is unrealistic. Instead, it’s more practical to predict the actions that could cause future disadvantages and lightly block those escape routes ahead of time. Setting up environments and rules that make it harder for your future self to slack off — that is the essence of a commitment device.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  Examples of Commitment Devices
</h1>

<p>By now, you may have a rough idea of what kinds of things can serve as commitment devices. Here are some representative examples.</p>

<p>For instance, the following are all valid commitment devices:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Not keeping snacks at home<br>
= Preventing the unwanted behavior of unnecessary snacking in the first place</p></li>
<li><p>Leaving your phone in a different room<br>
= Physically blocking the behavior of reaching for your phone when you don't need it</p></li>
<li><p>Going for a walk without your wallet<br>
= Preventing impulse purchases you might regret later</p></li>
<li><p>Making your desk a "work-only space"<br>
= Establishing a rule that "when I sit here, I work," which naturally encourages focus</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these require special tools or expensive equipment. What matters is accepting the premise that your future self is vulnerable to temptation. Once you acknowledge the habits you want to avoid, even the smallest adjustments can function as commitment devices.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Tip: Why Do Commitment Devices Work?
</h2>

<p>Let’s briefly look into why commitment devices are so effective.</p>

<p>First, humans have a strong instinct to choose the easiest option. As a result, we tend to prioritize immediate comfort over long-term benefits. This tendency is known as present bias.</p>

<p>On top of that, daily life is filled with countless decisions. These accumulate and cause decision fatigue, gradually draining our willpower.</p>

<ul>
<li>"I shouldn’t eat this, but I want to."
</li>
<li>"I should keep working, but I want to check social media."</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though these internal conflicts aren't actions themselves, they silently consume mental energy in the background.</p>

<p>Eventually, in the middle of work, a small thought like<br><br>
"Maybe I’ll just check my phone for a minute…"<br><br>
quickly snowballs into procrastination.</p>

<p>That’s why:</p>

<p>→ Removing the temptation from your sight altogether is far more effective for conserving willpower and increasing success.</p>

<p>This is the core principle that makes commitment devices powerful.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  Other Types of Commitment Devices (Alternative Approaches)
</h1>

<p>So far, the commitment devices we explored were basic forms such as "removing" or "restricting" access. However, there are also more forceful types that rely on external factors.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Using Money as a Commitment
</h2>

<p>This approach uses the psychology of "I paid for it, so I should not waste it."</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Charging yourself a penalty if you fail to reach a goal
</li>
<li>Paying for an online language course upfront
</li>
<li>Signing a yearly gym contract</li>
</ul>

<p>Humans naturally avoid losses. This loss aversion makes financial commitments a strong motivator.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Public Accountability
</h2>

<p>Many people find that being observed by others drastically increases their ability to stick with a behavior. The risk of embarrassment or losing credibility makes it harder to break the commitment.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Announcing on social media that you will post something daily
</li>
<li>Reporting progress regularly to friends or coworkers</li>
</ul>

<p>Setting these as external rules helps boost consistency and success rates.</p>




<p>As we’ve seen, commitment devices are not limited to simply "removing" or "restricting" temptations. Using external costs or social pressure can also be extremely effective in shaping behavior.</p>

<p>And the variety doesn’t end there. By combining environmental adjustments, financial stakes, and social accountability, you can create systems that make controlling your behavior much easier.</p>

<p>What matters most is understanding which types work best for you and implementing them in a way that doesn’t feel forced. Small, consistent adjustments in your daily life can lead to surprisingly meaningful changes.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Tip: Caution Points and Practical Tips
</h2>

<p>Commitment devices are highly effective, but they’re not perfect. There are a few things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the restriction is too strong, it may cause a rebound.
</li>
<li>Striving for perfection makes continuation harder.
</li>
<li>If the purpose is unclear, the commitment becomes mere hardship.</li>
</ul>

<p>The key is adjusting your rules to a level that feels naturally manageable. This alone can dramatically increase your consistency.</p>

<p>So how can you implement commitment devices in a sustainable way? Here are some practical and easy-to-apply tips.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Start with small restrictions
</h3>

<p>No need to create big rules right away.<br><br>
Try something like "leave your phone in another room for one hour."<br><br>
Low-effort beginnings help build early success.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Set “exception rules”
</h3>

<p>For example:  </p>

<ul>
<li>One free day per week
</li>
<li>No rules during travel
</li>
</ul>

<p>These soft boundaries prevent burnout and make long-term continuation easier.</p>

<p>Some commitments also work well as time-limited challenges such as "just for two weeks" or "only this month."</p>

<h1>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h1>

<p>Finally, I’d like to share the personal reason that inspired this article.</p>

<p>Recently, I caught a mild illness while also going through a move, and my usual routines changed drastically. I had a habit of drinking only on weekends and playing games at night, but I stopped drinking for health reasons. Since unpacking after the move felt exhausting, and I wasn’t in great condition, I naturally stopped playing games too.</p>

<p>These were small forms of relaxation for me — not obsessions. But by coincidence, multiple circumstances overlapped, and I ended up not doing them at all. Surprisingly, this accidental restriction led to a noticeable increase in productivity.</p>

<p>Of course, since illness and moving were the triggers, this situation is not a strict commitment device. However, the effect — "unintentionally restricting behaviors that were not helpful" — was essentially the same.</p>

<p>In the end, regardless of the reason, recognizing the behaviors you should avoid and creating distance from them is often the first step toward meaningful change. And intentionally creating these conditions, instead of leaving them to chance, is what commitment devices are all about.</p>

<p>By incorporating small rules or environmental adjustments into your daily life, you can improve your behavior in a way that feels natural and effortless. Through my own experience, I was reminded just how powerful these small structures can be.</p>

<p>Everyone has a completely different lifestyle and situation.<br><br>
But if reading this article made you think of even one habit you’d like to improve, I encourage you to try making a small adjustment.</p>

<p>Commitment devices don’t require complex systems or perfect plans. Even simple, everyday tweaks can be surprisingly effective. A tiny step today may end up helping your future self far more than you expect.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
