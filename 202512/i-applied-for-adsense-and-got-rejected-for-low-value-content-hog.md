<p>A month ago I posted here about building a developer tools site using AI. Since then I've added more tools, written blog posts, built out an API directory.</p>

<p>I figured it was time to monetize. Applied for AdSense. Got rejected.</p>

<p>The reason? "Low value content."</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Wait, What?
</h2>

<p>Every tool page has explanations, FAQs, use cases, step-by-step instructions. I have an about page, privacy policy, contact page. Original blog posts. This isn't a thin site with an input box and a wall of ads.</p>

<p>But Google disagreed.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What I Learned
</h2>

<p>After researching this, "low value content" is basically Google's catch-all rejection for new sites. The actual reasons have little to do with content quality:</p>

<p><strong>Site age</strong> - Google wants 3-6 months of history before they trust you. My site is too new.</p>

<p><strong>Traffic</strong> - They want sites that already have visitors. Classic chicken-and-egg problem.</p>

<p><strong>Tool sites get flagged</strong> - Too many spammy utility sites have ruined it for everyone. Google's algorithms are skeptical by default.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What I'm Doing About It
</h2>

<p>Not panicking. The content is solid. My plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wait 3-4 weeks and reapply. Many people get approved on attempt #2 or #3 with zero changes.</li>
<li>Keep publishing. More content, consistent activity.</li>
<li>Focus on traffic first. SEO, community engagement, being actually helpful in places like this.</li>
<li>Consider alternatives. Ezoic, Carbon Ads, or just keep building and worry about monetization later.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
  
  
  The Real Lesson
</h2>

<p>Chasing AdSense approval is probably the wrong priority for a new site. The goal isn't to run an ad farm. It's to build something useful.</p>

<p>If I do that well, monetization will follow. And by the time Google approves me, I probably won't need them as badly anyway.</p>




<p>I wrote a longer breakdown on my blog if you want the full story: <a href="https://toolpod.dev/blog/adsense-rejection-low-value-content" rel="noopener noreferrer">What "Low Value Content" Actually Means</a></p>

<p>Anyone else dealt with AdSense rejection? What worked for you?</p>
