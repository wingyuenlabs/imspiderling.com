<h3>
  
  
  Why I Ditched Terminal UIs for Recruiters
</h3>

<p>I built a terminal-style portfolio.</p>

<p>Black screen. Commands. ASCII vibes.<br>
It felt clever. It felt personal. It felt <em>very me</em>.</p>

<p>And almost everyone said the same thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“This is cool… but recruiters won’t get it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were right.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  The terminal UI problem 🧠
</h3>

<p>Terminal portfolios are fun for developers.<br>
They signal:</p>

<ul>
<li>You’re technical</li>
<li>You’re confident</li>
<li>You like bending conventions</li>
</ul>

<p>But recruiters don’t explore. They skim.</p>

<p>They want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who are you?</li>
<li>What do you build?</li>
<li>Can I understand this in 10 seconds?</li>
</ul>

<p>A blinking cursor asking them to type <code>help</code> already lost half the room.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  The uncomfortable realization ⚠️
</h3>

<p>My terminal UI wasn’t failing because it was bad.</p>

<p>It was failing because it required <strong>participation</strong>.</p>

<p>Recruiters don’t want to interact.<br>
They want to <em>recognize</em>.</p>

<p>That’s when it clicked:<br>
A portfolio isn’t a playground. It’s a <strong>signal amplifier</strong>.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  The pivot 🎯
</h3>

<p>I rebuilt my portfolio as:</p>

<ul>
<li>UI-first</li>
<li>Motion-driven</li>
<li>Immediately readable</li>
</ul>

<p>Big typography.<br>
Clear sections.<br>
Subtle animation instead of clever commands.</p>

<p>Same personality. Different delivery.</p>

<p>The irony?<br>
More people noticed my work <em>after</em> I made it simpler.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  What I learned ✅
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cool ideas still need clear entry points</li>
<li>A portfolio is not for you, it’s for your audience</li>
<li>You can still be creative without being cryptic</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t kill the terminal UI idea.<br>
I just stopped forcing it on people who didn’t ask for it.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  Curious how it turned out?
</h3>

<p>I rebuilt my portfolio to be <strong>UI-first, motion-heavy, and recruiter-readable</strong><br>
without killing the personality.</p>

<p>Fair warning:<br>
I still overengineered it. Just more responsibly this time.</p>
