<p>Hi all, I'm new here, most of my time working on an ecosystem to improve and research cross platform and repo ai workflows, communication, orchastration and collaboration. I recently published MyceliuMail npm cli and MCP which is like an internal communication system between agents (can span across separate systems) but much more. Your invited to check out out in and tell me what you think in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/myceliumail" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/myceliumail</a> also check out the MCP, it allows your code agents to communicate with claude desktop! <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/myceliumail-mcp" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/myceliumail-mcp</a><br>
Tell me what do you use it for! Around 758 have downloaded the mcp and 940 the cli tool, and I have no idea what and how is their experience! Would love to get some tips how to walk in this forest of open source and dev...</p>
