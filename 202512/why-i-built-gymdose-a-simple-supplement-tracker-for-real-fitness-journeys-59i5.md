<p>Over the last couple of years, fitness has become a huge part of my life. I lost <strong>45 kilograms</strong> through training, daily cardio, eating better, and staying consistent with my supplements. And even though I was motivated, there was one simple thing I kept messing up:<br><br>
<strong>I couldn’t remember which supplements I had taken each day.</strong></p>

<p>Some mornings I’d double-dose my omega-3 without realizing. Some nights I’d remember I forgot my multivitamin. Some days I’d start creatine loading… and then completely forget the next day.</p>

<p>It sounds small, but when you’re serious about your fitness, these details matter.<br><br>
And I hated the feeling of being inconsistent after working so hard.</p>

<p>That’s how <strong>GymDose</strong> started — not as an app for the world, but as an app for <em>me</em>.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  From Personal Problem → Personal Tool → Public App
</h2>

<p>I tried using habit trackers, to-do apps, reminder apps, and “all-in-one” fitness apps.<br><br>
But everything felt too bloated or unnecessarily complicated.</p>

<p>I didn’t want badges, charts, motivational quotes, or 40 menu items.<br><br>
I just wanted something simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the app
</li>
<li>See my supplements
</li>
<li>Tap what I took
</li>
<li>Close it
</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it.</p>

<p>So I built exactly that — a <strong>minimal supplement tracker</strong> that fits naturally into a fitness routine.</p>

<p>It started as a private project. Something for my own daily use. But after using it for months, refining the UI, fixing the flow, and realizing it genuinely helped me stay consistent, I decided to release it publicly.</p>

<p>That’s how <strong>GymDose</strong> went live on the App Store.</p>

<p>If you want to try it:<br><br>

<h2>
  
  
  Designed for People Who Actually Train
</h2>

<p>GymDose is built from the perspective of someone who loves lifting, supplements, and self-improvement. The design is intentionally:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean
</li>
<li>Dark and minimal
</li>
<li>Fast to use
</li>
<li>Zero clutter
</li>
</ul>

<p>Because when you train almost every day, have pre-workout routines, post-workout routines, late-night supplements, and early-morning creatine… the last thing you want is a noisy, over-engineered app.</p>

<p>The goal was simple:<br><br>
<strong>Make consistency easier than ever.</strong></p>

<p>And because I track my own supplements every single day, every screen was designed with real use in mind.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  What GymDose Helps You Do
</h2>

<h3>

Set your own schedule that fits <em>your</em> routine.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Built by One Person With a Lot of Care
</h2>

<p>I built GymDose myself — the design, code, UX, testing, everything.</p>

<p>And because I’m still deep in my fitness journey, I use the app every day. That’s why every update has a purpose: small improvements that make it easier and smoother to track supplements without thinking about it.</p>

<p>I’m planning more updates soon, and if you have feedback, I truly read every message.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why Supplements Matter in My Journey
</h2>

<p>When I say supplements helped me, I mean it.</p>

<p>During my weight loss — from <strong>99 kg down to 54 kg lost total</strong> — consistency was everything. Supplements aren’t magic, but when you train hard, sleep properly, and eat well, they help you stay healthy, energized, and recover better.</p>

<p>But consistency is the real game-changer.</p>

<p>That’s why GymDose exists:<br><br>
<strong>to remove one tiny barrier from your fitness routine and make staying consistent easier.</strong></p>
