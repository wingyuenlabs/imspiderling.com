<h2>
  
  
  Background
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  It's Needless to Say Asynchronous Work is Valuable
</h3>

<p>As engineers, we require concentration, but the tools, methods, and procedures needed for that concentration vary from person to person. A single environment like an office has its limitations.</p>

<p>Moreover, before being engineers, we are human beings, and as humans, we want to minimize life's burdens. For instance, getting exhausted from commuting is ludicrous. Even if it's a 30-minute one-way commute, with preparation, settling in, and context-switching, it's <strong>effectively equivalent to about 1 hour one way</strong>. That's 2 hours round trip. Imagine what could be done in those 2 hours.</p>

<p>To ensure each individual's concentration and care for their well-being, remote work is essential. This necessitates asynchronous work.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Reality of a Shift Back to Office Presence
</h3>

<p>Even giants like GAFAM and MATANA are still advocating for a return to the office. It's obvious that productivity can result from being in a physical office. Confining people by time and place is exploitative, and it's no surprise that exploiting can yield results. Much like an oppressive regime of a king, you can achieve outcomes by forcing slaves to overwork.</p>

<p>Even without such force, most people inexplicably prefer to gather. Certainly, gatherings are lively, fun, and socially satisfying, but that's all. While it might work for some, it is not favorable in terms of concentration and stress load. It's not something that should be forced on everyone.</p>

<p>Why does this imposition still run rampant? Simply put, people who prefer this collective way of working are in power. Furthermore, as organizations grow, inefficiencies and sabotage structurally increase, leading to using office attendance as a loyalty test.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Seemingly Full Remote But...
</h3>

<p>In many organizations that might seem fully remote or close to it, there are <strong>cases where they are consistently engaged in online meetings</strong>. This is no different from being at the office.</p>

<p>Office work binds both time and place, while online meetings bind only time. The binding exists either way. To achieve focus and care, the binding must be reduced. It is also necessary to reduce online meetings.</p>

<p>Thus, <strong>asynchronous work means working remotely without relying on online meetings</strong>.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  A Perspective to Establish Asynchronous Work
</h3>

<p>In my years of advocating, I've realized that many don't grasp the prerequisites for establishing asynchronous work.</p>

<p>This time, I'll articulate what these prerequisites are. We'll consider communication as a task.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Communication As A Task
</h2>

<p><strong>Communication As A Task</strong> is a concept where communication is seen as a task. <strong>It is abbreviated as CaaT</strong>.</p>

<p>In asynchronous work, communication naturally becomes asynchronous communication. Many people dislike asynchronous communication simply because they do not understand the underlying concepts.</p>

<p>Asynchronous communication should be perceived as a task.</p>

<p>A task has the concept of being open and closed. It begins when opened and ends when closed. This means that all opportunities for communication and the topics covered therein are handled as tasks. Bringing everything to a point where completing a task means it's finished provides clarity.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Example
</h2>

<p>Suppose Manager M and Engineer E have a 45-minute 1-on-1 meeting. The topics are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>1: Icebreaker</li>
<li>2: E's career</li>
<li>3: Topics 1 and 2 concerning Project P</li>
<li>4: The poor compatibility and handling of members M1 and M2 in P</li>
<li>5: Closing</li>
</ul>

<p>So how would this look under CaaT? It would be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Task 1: "Icebreaker", conclude in 3 minutes</li>
<li>Task 2: "About E's career"</li>
<li>Task 3: "Topic 1 concerning Project P"</li>
<li>Task 4: "Topic 2 concerning Project P"</li>
<li>Task 5: "Compatibility and handling of members M1 and M2 in P"</li>
<li>Task 6: "Closing", conclude in 2 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, everything becomes a task. We then think about completing all six tasks.</p>

<ul>
<li>The icebreaker and closing should be time-bound. They automatically end after the specified time.</li>
<li>The other tasks can be regular. Once either or both agree to close, it's over.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, <strong>it's not necessary to conduct these six tasks as a meeting</strong>. They can be done asynchronously. If using Slack, create a channel with both E and M and open six threads. If using GitHub Issues, open six issues.</p>

<p>In fact, if it's asynchronous, you might not need an icebreaker or closing, so four would suffice. Or, if you want small talk, open a dedicated thread or issue for ongoing discussion.</p>

<p>This is the approach. Consider the communication topics as tasks with opening and closing.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Does It Seem Bland?
</h2>

<p>Many may find CaaT to be "bland" or "lacking in humanity."</p>

<p>Admittedly, that's true, but is it necessarily an issue? We are engineers, and this is work—not playtime with friends. We're not students anymore; we should have professional consciousness.</p>

<p>Certainly, as humans, some social interaction is necessary, but a dedicated opportunity can address that. Meeting weekly, monthly, or even at a lower frequency could suffice. Many organizations conduct retreats.</p>

<p>I call this <strong>Communication Time</strong> and recommend securing social time as "part of work hours without working." Whether it's Minecraft, board games, or just chatting—it doesn't matter. You can do it regularly or spontaneously adjust as you like. An example of the latter is <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitLab's Coffee Chat</a>, where anyone can request a 1-on-1 with anyone at any time.</p>
