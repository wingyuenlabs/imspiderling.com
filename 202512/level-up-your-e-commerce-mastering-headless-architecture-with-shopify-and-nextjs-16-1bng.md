<p>I am excited to share my latest effort: building a fully custom, high-performance storefront for Shopify using a headless architecture powered by Next.js 16 (App Router).</p>

<p>The key benefit here is the ability to scale the frontend and achieve uncompromising speed, moving past the constraints of typical e-commerce platform themes.</p>

<p>Check out the live application's performance and the clean code structure on GitHub.</p>
