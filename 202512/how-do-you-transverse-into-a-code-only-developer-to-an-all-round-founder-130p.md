<p>I am a software developer with several years of experience building startups for founders and I always thought that's the hardest part.</p>

<p>I started appreciating my former boss recently when I decided to build my idea. It was easy for my experience. I built <a href="https://chattatutor.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChattaTutor</a>, an app that allows you to generate bite-sized micro-courses with graphical representations, summaries, flashcards, and quizzes. It also allows you to create study groups and allow you challenge your colleagues in a 1v1 quiz contest. You can customise your summaries too.</p>

<p>I've built the MVP, the Waitlist is open at the website.</p>

<p>The problem is that I am just discovering how much extra goes into actually rolling out a product. Building seems to be the list of it.</p>

<p>I'm waiting for business registration approval and payment gateways, I'm thinking of branding, launch materials, launch time and strategy, SEO optimisation and so many other things. Lead generation, school partnerships, etc. So many things to do. </p>

<p>It's crazy.</p>

<p>If you have gone down this line before, what advise do you have?</p>
