<p>Did you know that AI-powered systems can be "trained" to identify the unique "digital fingerprint" of a compromised device, even when it's trying to hide its identity? This concept, known as "zero-knowledge proof" in cryptography, allows AI to verify the authenticity of a device without accessing its internal state. By analyzing subtle variations in network traffic patterns, AI can detect anomalies that indicate a device has been compromised, enabling swift containment and remediation of threats. This innovative approach has the potential to transform the field of cybersecurity threat detection.</p>
