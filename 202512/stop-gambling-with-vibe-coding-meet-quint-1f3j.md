<p>Let's be real for a second. Prompting Claude, Cursor, or ChatGPT feels amazing... until it doesn't.</p>

<p>You know the cycle:</p>

<ol>
<li>You type a vague prompt like "Make me a auth system."</li>
<li>The AI spits out 200 lines of beautiful-looking TypeScript.</li>
<li>You get that dopamine hit. "I am a 10x engineer!"</li>
<li>You run it.</li>
<li>ERROR: undefined is not a function.</li>
<li>You spend the next 4 hours debugging code you didn't write and barely understand.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s not engineering. That’s a slot machine with syntax highlighting.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  The Problem: AI (and most of us frequently) Has No "Chill"
</h4>

<p>Vibe coding is chaotic because LLMs are people-pleasers. They want to give you code now, regardless of whether it actually makes sense architecturally. They lack a Thinking Framework. They don't check invariants.</p>

<p>They just... vibe.</p>

<p>What if you could force the AI to actually think before it types?</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Enter Quint 🛠️
</h3>

<p>Quint is a tiny, no-nonsense toolkit for AI-assisted engineering.</p>

<p>It’s not a new IDE. It’s not a bloated SaaS wrapper. It’s a set of CLI commands (currently) that act as a "Thinking OS" for your AI tool collaboration – making both of you more rigorous.</p>

<p>Whether you use Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, or Codex, Quint sits in the middle and says: "Hey AI, before you write that function, prove to me it won't break the build."</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Why You Should Care (Right Now)
</h3>

<p>The current version is commands set only. No UI. No dependencies to break anything. Tiny, almost zero overhead in the context for your Claude Code or Cursor.</p>

<p>But We’ve been using it in real scenarious of tackling highly complex engineering and even marketing tasks, and you know what... the difference in the results quality is wild. </p>

<p>Instead of getting "plausible spaghetti," we get decision records that actually respect the goals and are linked with evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>It just make sense.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>
  
  
  What's Under The Hood? 🧠
</h4>

<p>The current latest version of Quint Code implements about 10% of the <a href="https://github.com/ailev/FPF" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Principles Framework</a> (FPF) – an original, brilliant but formal, and very complex specification of the "thinking OS" created by Anatoly Levenchuk.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you're thinking: "Only 10%? Why release it?"</p>

<p>Because that 10% is the Pareto Principle in action. It turns out you don't need a PhD in Formal Logic to improve AI and AI + Human collaborative reasoning. </p>

<p>You just need to force the AI to acknowledge few Invariants and Reasoning Chains. And then act as External Transformer, like an Oracle or... Overseer.</p>

<p>Even this minimal implementation forces AI agents to plan the decisions and thus the follow-up work much better than any heuristic planners and to-dos.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  🔮 The Near Future: v4.0.0 &amp; The MCP Hype Train
</h4>

<p>We are close to dropping v4.0.0, and it’s going to be a banger.</p>

<p>We're introducing a tiny MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server which will handle FPF kernel and Invariants better in local sqlite database + same MD files.</p>

<p>It will allow Quint to feed the AI persistent context about your project's "Laws of Physics," as well as your rules and past decisions mostly automatically.</p>

<p>We're aiming for ~75% FPF Invariants support with this MCP. Still small. Still focused. But dramatically smarter.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  🧪 Try It. Break It. Roast It.
</h4>

<p>I don't want "polite" feedback. I want feedback from devs who are actually in the trenches using Cursor/Claude Code daily. Who have zero ideas about this scientific stuff and all the systems engineering formalities and methods that I do love, but the devs, as I said - in the trenches. And I need the feedback from the trenches.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it fit your flow?</li>
<li>Is the README too confusing?</li>
<li>Did it save you from a hallucination?</li>
<li>Did it help you to plan complex tasks better?</li>
</ul>

<p>Go ahead. Try it out. If it sucks, tell me why. If it fixes your vibe coding hangover, tell your friends.</p>

<p>Quint is a small tool, but it has a damn big brain energy.</p>
