<p>Hey everyone!<br>
I'm Thomas, a Rust developer, I have been working on a personal project for more than 3 years, chess-tui, a chess game you can play from your terminal made in rust 🦀 !</p>

<p>I am happy to announce I made a new version that lets you play real chess games against Lichess opponents right from your terminal.</p>

<p>Would love to have your feedbacks on that project !</p>
