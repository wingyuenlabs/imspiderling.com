<p>A quick summary typed by my own thumbs and infographic generated by Nano Banana Pro :)</p>

<p>Last year, AWS offloaded EKS node management and scaling by introducing EKS Auto Mode. Customers did not have to deal with scaling nodes, upgrading nodes etc. This gave the customers more time to deploy and manage their applications. </p>

<p>This year, EKS has decided to offload managing your ArgoCD, ACK and kro. EKS would manage them for you by running them separately. </p>

<p>There are pros and cons for this feature. </p>

<p>Pro being there is now one less thing to manage. Since ArgoCD, ACK and kro are not running in your EKS worker nodes, you don't pay for them. AWS takes care of running them, scaling, upgrading them and making sure they are running fine. </p>

<p>Con is that EKS charges it as part of EKS Capabilities pricing. Not all features might be supported. Customization is not possible. </p>

<p>So you need to decide whether this extra cost is worth it or not. It depends on the expertise of the team, how many clusters they are managing and how many applications each ArgoCD is managing. </p>

<p>From the pricing, number of ArgoCD applications dictates how costly it is going to be, rest all other features and capabilities are relatively cheaper. </p>

<p>My dear friend Jatin Mehrotra wrote an <a href="https://dev.to/aws-builders/i-created-s3-buckets-using-argocd-ack-with-eks-capabilities-no-controllers-installed-cm0">excellent blog</a> about EKS capabilities and also found a bug.  </p>
