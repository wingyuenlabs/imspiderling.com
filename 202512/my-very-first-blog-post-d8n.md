<p>I've always wanted to learn how to code, so in 2024 I got a job that allowed me to save up enough money to buy myself a PC (it was my friend's PC ). It was literally the best experience of my life, I went on YouTube watching every web development video I could get my hands on. From there I progressed to downloading tutorials from a particular source 🌚. I was enjoying the tutorials until I got to a point where I was struggling a bit to watch another lecture video.<br>
Eventually I finished a course on HTML and CSS, I thought that was it... I had learnt how to code, that narrative changed when I actually sat down to build an actual project on my own without the help of any tutorial, that was when I realized that I still have a long way to go.<br>
I decided to take up coding challenge from Frontend mentor (A site with Frontend projects) to reinforce my learning with HTML and CSS, and to be honest I saw the extent of my limit, it was frustrating and at the same time annoying.<br>
I then went back to the basics which helped me actually attempt a few challenges, I was happy to see I was making tiny improvements, right now I've built upto 8 frontend mentor projects, and I don't intend on stopping there. <br>
Well that's it for now.<br>
I'm gonna look back at this one day and go wow! I've made progress.</p>
