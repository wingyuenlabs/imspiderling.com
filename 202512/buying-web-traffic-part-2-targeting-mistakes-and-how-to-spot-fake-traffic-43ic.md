<p>In Part 1, I covered why people buy web traffic and when it can make sense as a growth tool. In this follow-up, I want to focus on what actually determines whether paid traffic helps—or quietly drains your budget: proper targeting and the ability to recognize fake traffic before it causes damage.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Category Selection Is Not Optional
</h2>

<p>One of the easiest ways to waste money on traffic is choosing the wrong audience category.</p>

<p>Traffic providers often let you select interests or verticals. If those don’t align with your site, conversions won’t happen—no matter how “high quality” the traffic claims to be.</p>

<p>For example, sending automotive-focused users to a gardening website won’t produce engagement. Even real people won’t take action if the content doesn’t match their intent. Relevance always comes first.</p>

<p>Before buying traffic, be clear about:</p>

<ul>
<li>What problem your site solves</li>
<li>Who is actively looking for that solution</li>
<li>Which categories naturally overlap with your content</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Geography Matters More Than People Expect
</h2>

<p>Geographic targeting mistakes are another common failure point.</p>

<p>If your product is only available in specific countries, traffic from outside those regions has zero business value. Selling UK-only products to visitors from Southeast Asia won’t lead to conversions, even if the traffic is real.</p>

<p>When setting location targeting, think through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where you can actually ship or operate</li>
<li>Which languages your site supports</li>
<li>Regional legal or compliance restrictions</li>
<li>Payment methods available in each country</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting this right takes a few minutes, but getting it wrong can invalidate an entire campaign.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Real Risk: Fake Traffic
</h2>

<p>The biggest danger when buying traffic isn’t poor targeting—it’s fake traffic.</p>

<p>Fake traffic (often called “ghost” traffic) is generated by automated systems, not real people. These systems simulate visits well enough that many analytics tools treat them like normal users.</p>

<p>That’s why fake traffic is hard to detect at first glance. Bots don’t announce themselves; they just quietly inflate numbers while producing no real engagement.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How to Tell If Traffic Is Real
</h2>

<p>You won’t identify fake traffic by looking at surface-level metrics. Instead, focus on behavior patterns.</p>

<p><strong>Average Session Duration</strong></p>

<p>Session duration shows how long visitors stay on your page.</p>

<p>Organic traffic from search engines typically averages around 40–60 seconds for informational pages. Fake traffic, on the other hand, often results in session durations close to zero because bots don’t interact with content.</p>

<p>If you see sudden spikes in traffic paired with near-instant exits, that’s a strong warning sign.</p>

<p><strong>Bounce Rate</strong></p>

<p>Bounce rate measures how many users leave after viewing just one page.</p>

<p>While bounce rate varies by site type (blogs and news sites naturally have higher rates), fake traffic often pushes bounce rate close to 100%. That indicates visitors are arriving and leaving without any interaction at all.</p>

<p>A consistently extreme bounce rate combined with low session duration is rarely normal.</p>

<p><strong>Pageviews per Session</strong></p>

<p>Real users behave differently: some read one page and leave, others click deeper into the site.</p>

<p>With fake traffic, pageviews per session are usually flat—often stuck at exactly one. Bots don’t browse; they hit a URL and disappear.</p>

<p><strong>Percent of New Sessions</strong></p>

<p>When you buy traffic, it’s expected that most visitors are new at first. Seeing close to 100% new sessions initially is normal.</p>

<p>What matters is what happens afterward. Over time, real users return. If weeks go by and every visitor is still “new,” that suggests the traffic isn’t human.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Metrics That Don’t Help Much
</h2>

<p>Some commonly referenced metrics aren’t useful for detecting fake traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Sessions</strong></p>

<p>A session simply records a visit—human or bot. Automated traffic can generate sessions that look perfectly valid in analytics.</p>

<p><strong>Users</strong></p>

<p>Similarly, the “users” metric counts anything that has at least one session. It doesn’t reliably distinguish real people from automated signals.</p>

<p>These metrics are fine for volume tracking, but they won’t help you assess traffic quality.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How to Avoid Fake Traffic Providers
</h2>

<p>You can often spot low-quality or scam providers before spending any money.</p>

<p>Things to check:</p>

<ul>
<li>Website quality: Poor design, broken English, or vague explanations are red flags.</li>
<li>Business details: Legitimate providers list real addresses and company information.</li>
<li>Google Maps presence: A verified listing with reviews adds credibility.</li>
<li>External reviews: Look beyond testimonials hosted on the provider’s own site.</li>
<li>Small test orders: Always test with minimal spend before scaling.</li>
<li>Refund policy: Clear replacement or refund terms indicate confidence in traffic quality.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a provider avoids transparency or guarantees “instant conversions,” that’s usually a bad sign.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Final Thoughts
</h2>

<p>Buying web traffic isn’t inherently good or bad—it’s a tool. Used carefully, it can help validate content, test funnels, or accelerate visibility. Used carelessly, it can inflate metrics while delivering no real value.</p>

<p>The basics matter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Target the right audience category</li>
<li>Match traffic to your geographic reality</li>
<li>Monitor behavioral metrics, not just volume</li>
<li>Test small before committing</li>
<li>Avoid providers that hide details or overpromise</li>
</ul>
