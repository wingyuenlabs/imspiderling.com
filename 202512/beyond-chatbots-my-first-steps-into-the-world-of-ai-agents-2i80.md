<p>I have always been fascinated by Computer Science and technology. Like many others, I have been using tools like ChatGPT for a while now. I used to think AI was just about asking questions and getting answers. But after exploring the Kaggle AI Agents Intensive, I realized that the future of tech is much bigger than just "smart chatbots."</p>

<p><strong>What Changed My Mind?</strong><br>
The biggest takeaway for me was learning the difference between a standard LLM and an AI Agent.</p>

<p><strong>LLMs talk:</strong> They are great at predicting text and giving information.<br>
<strong>Agents act:</strong> They can actually do things.</p>

<p>The concept that an AI can use "Tools"—like searching the web or running code—was really exciting to learn. It feels like giving the AI a pair of hands to interact with the digital world.</p>

<p><strong>The Logic Behind the Magic</strong><br>
I also really liked learning about the ReAct (Reason + Act) loop. As a student who loves diving into how things work, seeing how the agent "thinks" before it acts made a lot of sense. It showed me that AI isn't just magic; it's a structured process of reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong><br>
I plan to study Computer Science in the future, and this course has given me a head start. It opened my eyes to what is possible. I am no longer just thinking about writing code; I am thinking about how to build systems that can solve problems on their own.</p>

<p>This was a short but powerful learning experience. I can’t wait to learn more and eventually build my own agents!</p>
