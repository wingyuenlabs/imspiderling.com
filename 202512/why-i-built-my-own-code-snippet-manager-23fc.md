<p>As a developer, I realized something after working on multiple projects:<br>
the hardest part isn’t complex logic — it’s repeating the same things over and over again.</p>

<p>Validation helpers, utility functions, common patterns.<br>
Every new project started with me opening old repositories, searching files, and copy–pasting code I had already written before.</p>

<p>Instead of accepting this as “normal developer behavior”, I decided to experiment with a different approach.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>The Idea</strong>
</h2>

<p>I wanted a place where:</p>

<ul>
<li>My tested code snippets live permanently</li>
<li>Everything is searchable in seconds</li>
<li>The interface stays calm and distraction-free</li>
<li>No ads, no subscriptions</li>
</ul>

<p>That experiment became CodeSnippet Pro — a personal snippet vault built as an independent product.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Tech Stack</strong>
</h2>

<ul>
<li>CodeIgniter v4.6.4</li>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>Tailwind CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
<li>Formspree API</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of my focus went into UI consistency, micro-interactions, and reducing visual friction.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>What I Learned</strong>
</h2>

<p>Developer productivity often improves not by adding powerful features,<br>
but by removing small, repeated frictions.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Live Version</strong>
</h2>

<p>The live version is currently available in Indonesian,<br>
but the interface should still be self-explanatory:</p>

<p>I’m still iterating on this project and very open to feedback,<br>
especially around frontend structure and user experience.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading 🙏</p>
