<p>Today we're launching off our waitlist, and letting anyone <a href="https://app.buildstash.com/register" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up to try out Buildstash</a> - free and without any barriers. We're so excited to take this next big step in our mission to make better software binary and release management accessible to all software teams.</p>

<p>Plus, we've also launched a <a href="https://docs.buildstash.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Docs site</a>, with comprehensive documentation for our platform, integrations, and API.</p>

<p>And, all of this is just "Day 1" of our first <a href="https://buildstash.com/launch-week" rel="noopener noreferrer">Launch Week</a> - we'll be launching a new feature every single day this week.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The journey here
</h2>

<p>We started working on Buildstash after noticing a recurring pattern across software teams we'd worked on - whether in mobile apps, game development, work for clients, or in embedded - there was a shared problem:</p>

<p>Teams would of course version code; and if they had a good workflow in place, there would likely be some sort of CI/CD pipeline to build that code.. but once they had the built binary?</p>

<p>Most had no effective system for managing them. Maybe dumping past builds in a shared folder, providing someone remembers. Often mislabeled, or inconsistently versioned. Chaotic SharePoint and Google Drive folders with inflexible permissions. Frequently expired WeTransfer links when sharing with a client or publisher.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fixsxlaoa0d8x3ghudt9f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fixsxlaoa0d8x3ghudt9f.png" alt="Chaotic workflows" width="800" height="462"></a></p>

<p>And when it comes to guiding software through to release, there's a ton of different tools for issue tracking, QA, and deployment - but while they all relate to built binaries - whether testing, reviewing, or deploying - they're all disconnected from them too. Teams often end up falling back to Slack to keep track of what builds are where; what's been signed off or hasn't. And a ton of copying and pasting build numbers back and forth between tools.</p>

<p>We're looking to solve all of this with Buildstash.</p>

<p>We set out to build a platform for managing all built software binaries - of any type, wherever they're produced, and wherever they're being deployed or distributed*.</p>

<p>(*distinct from the limited existing tools out there for managing build artifacts - which are more narrowly focused on the problem of package repository management)</p>

<p>And, a complete workflow for guiding binaries through to release - integrating with the tools you already use, letting you easily attach builds - for example directly to a bug report in your issue tracking tool, and maintaining context.</p>

<p>Buildstash is the platform for managing, collaborating on, and distributing your software binaries.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fea5l8e4gt5d8du350qoa.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fea5l8e4gt5d8du350qoa.png" alt="Screenshot" width="800" height="452"></a></p>

<p>And with our launch of open sign up today, as well as the further major feature announcements <a href="https://buildstash.com/launch-week" rel="noopener noreferrer">rolling out this week</a>, we're at a point we feel confident the platform is mature enough to easily integrate in your workflow, and transform how you collaborate around your binaries.</p>

<p>Our aim is that one day you'll look back, and a time before dedicated binary management will seem as antiquated as a time before source control.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  No more waitlist
</h2>

<p>Waitlisters, wait no more.</p>

<p>While we've been slowly onboarding teams over the last year, we've been focused on supporting all of the varied workflows software teams have to steer their builds through test channels to release, and building <a href="https://docs.buildstash.com/integrations" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrations</a> with the tools they already use.</p>

<p>An absolute focus of ours is that wherever you make your builds, it should be extremely fast and easy to connect the source to Buildstash, and have your binaries seamlessly sent into the platform.</p>

</p>

<p>We've also obsessed over an improved onboarding experience - guiding you through setting up your first Workspace, connecting your build pipeline, and making use of our powerful distribution options for your binaries, build streams, and releases.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Improved docs
</h2>

<p>Along with us opening the platform up to everyone today, it was as important to also launch our improved and comprehensive <a href="https://docs.buildstash.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> - covering each step in getting your workspace setup, and getting the most out of the Buildstash platform.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F19tib6uc0p78hkkfp65f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F19tib6uc0p78hkkfp65f.png" alt="Buildstash docs screenshot" width="800" height="557"></a></p>

<p>As well as our new <a href="https://docs.buildstash.com/integrations" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrations directory</a>, and <a href="https://docs.buildstash.com/api" rel="noopener noreferrer">API reference guide</a> - look out for announcements relating to both of these <a href="https://buildstash.com/launch-week" rel="noopener noreferrer">later in the week</a>!</p>
