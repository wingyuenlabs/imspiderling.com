<p>👉 <a href="https://ecogovtest.comSustainability" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ecogovtest.comSustainability</a> challenges today go beyond the environment—they’re also technical and systemic. As developers, we have a role in building tools that support transparency, accountability, and long-term impact.</p>

<p>ecogovtest explores how environmental considerations can be better integrated into governance and technical systems. The focus is practical: testing ideas, working with data, and creating repeatable approaches that help make impact measurable and decisions clearer.</p>

<p>This work sits at the intersection of technology, environmental responsibility, and evidence-based governance—especially relevant for developers working with data pipelines, reporting, or decision-support systems.</p>
