<p><strong>koalaz</strong> is a mock data generator, designed for tests, prototypes, and developers who want something simple, fast, and a little fun.</p>

<p><strong>🐨 Why “koalaz”?</strong> Because koalas are chill animals, they sleep all day… and “koala” was already taken lol.</p>

<p><strong>⚙️ What does it do?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Generates placeholder data (names, numbers, objects, arrays…)</li>
<li>Supports tons of different data types (text, number, JSON, table, color, ASCII, email, password, and more)</li>
<li>Works offline too, with no external calls and no third-party dependencies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>📦 npm:</strong> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/koalaz" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/koalaz</a> <br>
💻 GitHub: github.com/mattqdev/koalaz</p>

<p>If you need a lighter and more fun alternative to Faker or Lorem Ipsum, or just want a meme-style mock tool, try koalaz. </p>
