<p>Nova Twins storm through a four-song Tiny Desk set with thunderous distorted bass, hip-hop beats and raspy vocals. Kicking off with the in-your-face “Cleopatra” and tackling inner demons on “Monsters,” Georgia South and Amy Love even duck under the desk to tweak their spaceship-sized pedalboards mid-show.</p>

<p>“Hummingbird” buzzes to life via a supernatural Harp Blaster mic, and drummer Jake Woodward helps them close out with full-on rock fury on “Choose Your Fighter.” It’s a bold reminder that nice, polite girls can shred—and then some.</p>
