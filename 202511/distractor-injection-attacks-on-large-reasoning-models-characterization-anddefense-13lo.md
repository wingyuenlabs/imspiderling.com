  When AI Gets Sidetracked: The Hidden Danger of Distractor Attacks
</h3>

<p>What if your smartest AI could be tricked by a hidden side‑quest? <strong>Researchers have uncovered</strong> that today’s <strong>large reasoning models</strong>—the same systems that solve math problems and write code—can be lured off‑track by sneaky, unrelated tasks slipped into a user’s prompt.<br>
 This “reasoning distraction” can slash the AI’s success rate by up to 60%, even in the most <strong>state‑of‑the‑art</strong> models.<br>
 Imagine a student trying to finish a test while a whispering voice keeps feeding them a different puzzle; the student’s focus falters, and the answers suffer.<br>
 The good news is that a new <strong>defense</strong> strategy—training the AI with fake distractor attacks—helps it stay on point, boosting its resilience by more than 50 points on tough tests.<br>
 As we rely on these clever machines for everyday help, keeping them focused isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a step toward a safer, more trustworthy future for everyone.<br>
