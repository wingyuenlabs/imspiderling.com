<p>I was building <a href="http://allpub.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer">allpub.co</a> (a smart cross-platform publishing tool) when I hit a problem that code couldn't solve: which LLM should I actually use?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The 3 AM Problem
</h2>

<p>It's late. I need AI-powered title generation, SEO extraction, and summaries for AllPub. Simple, right?</p>

<p>Not even close.</p>

<p>Should I use GPT-4? Great quality but insanely expensive. Claude 3 Haiku? Cheap but will it work well enough? Mistral? Llama? Deepseek? Each one has different tradeoffs. Speed versus cost. Quality versus infrastructure headaches.</p>

<p>Three hours later I've got 47 browser tabs open and zero clarity.</p>

<p>The frustrating part? I'm a developer. I can code anything. But I have no idea which LLM is actually right for my use case. And I'm betting thousands of other builders feel the exact same way.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Spreadsheet That Changed Everything
</h2>

<p>So I built a decision matrix. What's my actual use case? What tradeoffs can I accept? How many requests per month? Do I need self-hosted or API-based?</p>

<p>Once I answered those questions, Claude 3 Haiku became obvious. Not because it's the best model overall, but because it's the best model for AllPub's constraints.</p>

<p>That's when it clicked: what if there was a tool that did this for everyone?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Enter ArchitectGBT
</h2>

<p>Here's what I built:</p>

<p>architectgbt.com</p>

<p>You describe your project in plain English. "I need a chatbot that handles 1000 daily conversations with super low latency."</p>

<p>It analyze your constraints and recommend the best models ranked by speed, cost, and accuracy for YOUR use case specifically.</p>

<p>You see pricing breakdown and estimated monthly costs so you know what you're paying for.</p>

<p>You get code templates to start building immediately.</p>

<p>No spreadsheets. No guessing. No vendor bias. Just recommendations that make sense for your project.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why This Matters
</h2>

<p>The average engineer wastes 3 to 5 hours picking an LLM. But the real cost is picking wrong and overspending 30 to 50 percent every single month.</p>

<p>I've already heard from early users. One team was using GPT-4 for summarization when Claude Haiku would've worked fine. That's 2,400 dollars a month they could have saved.</p>

<p>ArchitectGBT cuts through the noise. You get the right recommendation for your specific situation, not what's trending on Twitter.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What's Next
</h2>

<p><a href="https://architectgbt.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">architectgbt</a> is in BETA right now and we need your feedback. Here's what I am thinking to build:</p>

<ol>
<li>Benchmarking suite so you can test your actual prompts across models.</li>
<li>Fine-tuning advisor to help you decide between self-hosted and API-based.</li>
<li>Team dashboard so your whole organization is aligned on model choices.</li>
<li>Budget alerts before you overspend.</li>
<li>Model routing that automatically picks the cheapest model that works for each request.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
  
  
  Try It
</h2>

<p>Go to <a href="https://architectgbt.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">architectgbt</a> and describe a real project you're working on.</p>

<p>Tell us if the recommendations are spot on or if we're way off.</p>

<p>Join the **waitlist **for the full features. Early testers get discounts.</p>

<p>That's it. The boring stuff works. The expensive stuff is expensive. Your constraints actually matter.</p>

<p>If you've ever wasted a few hours picking an LLM, this is for you.</p>
