  Everything Wrong With Thunderbolts* (The New Avengers) In 20 Minutes Or Less
</h1>

<p>CinemaSins is back with a rapid‐fire roast of <em>Thunderbolts</em>, pointing out all the “sins” you can cram into 20 minutes—yet still asking, “Is this movie kinda great?” Along the way, they link to their main site, extra YouTube channels (@TVSins, @commercialsins, @cinemasinspodcastnetwork), a quick poll to learn about you, and a Patreon if you want to keep the sin machine running.</p>

<p>They also roll credits for their writing team (Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian, Daniel) with Twitter/Instagram handles, plus all the community hangouts: Discord, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, and even Jeremy’s book.</p>
