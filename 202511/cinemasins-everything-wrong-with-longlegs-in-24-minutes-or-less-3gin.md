<p><strong>Everything Wrong With Longlegs In 24 Minutes Or Less</strong> is CinemaSins’ snarky breakdown of Nicolas Cage’s over-the-top performance in Osgood Perkins’ upcoming thriller Longlegs. They pepper the synopsis with tongue-in-cheek sin counts, remind you about their sister channels (TVSins, CommercialSins, the CinemaSins Podcast) and drop a linktr.ee for all things updates, polls, and Patreon support.</p>

<p>The razor-sharp commentary comes courtesy of Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian, and Daniel—each ready to point out every plot wobble and stylistic stumble. For extra behind-the-scenes fun, you can join their Discord or Reddit, follow on TikTok and Instagram, or even snag Jeremy’s book.</p>
