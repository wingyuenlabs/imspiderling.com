<p>Predator 2 (1990) ditches Schwarzenegger’s jungle for Danny Glover patrolling a heat-soaked, crime-ridden LA as he faces off against a souped-up Predator. It loses a few of the original’s familiar beats but delivers a fun, fresh ride—especially if you’re cool with Gary Busey popping up.</p>

<p>This breakdown comes courtesy of the “Caravan of Garbage” review, with early vids and bonus podcasts over at bigsandwich.co, plus extended audio on YouTube, social feeds for James &amp; Maso, and merch/podcasts if you’re keen to go deeper.</p>
