<p>Tailwind CSS has evolved a lot since the early v1 and v2 days. With Tailwind CSS 4.1 now the current stable release, most new UI kits are shipping with v4 in mind</p>

<p>Instead of hand crafting every button, hero and pricing section, you can drop in v4 ready components, tweak a few utility classes and ship. </p>

<p>Below you will find 21+ libraries that either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are fully free, or</li>
<li>Are premium but offer a meaningful set of free components or blocks
All of them are compatible with modern Tailwind projects, including v4.</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  1. Tailkits UI
</h2>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fh02co1yr0ctcx6wuhvah.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fh02co1yr0ctcx6wuhvah.png" alt="Tailkits UI" width="800" height="418"></a><br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Free + paid</p>

<p><strong>Stack:</strong> HTML + Tailwind</p>

<p><strong>Good for:</strong> Landing pages, SaaS, marketing sites</p>

<p><a href="https://tailkits.com/ui/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailkits UI</a> is a modern Tailwind component library built specifically for Tailwind v4. The landing page highlights <strong>Tailwind v4</strong> right in the hero, with an open source repo and FAQ confirming the components work with modern Tailwind (v3+) and have a path into v4 projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>30+ <strong>free</strong>, MIT licensed components across 20+ categories</li>
<li>200+ total sections in the paid plan, covering hero, pricing, FAQ, blog, navbars and more.</li>
<li>“No config needed” approach using Tailwind’s default utilities, so components drop cleanly into any v4 project</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want copy paste sections that already feel like polished marketing layouts and do not want to fight config, Tailkits UI is a great first stop.</p>

  2. Shadcnblocks
</h2>

</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Can you mix multiple Tailwind v4 libraries in one project?
</h2>

<p><strong>Yes, as long as you keep typography, spacing and color tokens consistent in your Tailwind design system.</strong></p>

<p>Most of these kits are plain Tailwind utilities without heavy extra CSS. That means you can mix Tailkits UI for marketing sections, Flowbite for forms and coss ui for app internals, then harmonize them with your Tailwind theme and a small layer of design tokens.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Final tips for using these Tailwind v4 UI kits
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Start from Tailkits’ directory</strong> when exploring new libraries, since they curate free and premium Tailwind resources that are explicitly v4 ready and updated weekly &gt;&gt; <a href="https://tailkits.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tailkits</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Read each library’s getting started guide</strong>, especially for Tailwind 4 setup, since some still show v3 examples and require small tweaks.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep a shared design system in your Tailwind config</strong> so mixing multiple kits still feels like one unified product.</li>
</ul>
