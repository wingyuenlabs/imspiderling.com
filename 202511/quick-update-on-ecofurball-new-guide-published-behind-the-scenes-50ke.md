<p>I’ve been continuing to chip away at EcoFurball — my little side project focused on sustainable, eco-friendly pet care. If you saw my earlier post, you know this is something I’m building slowly, one useful guide at a time.</p>

<p>This week, I published a new article that dives into something most pet owners (including me, originally) never think about: microplastics in our pets’ daily routine. From water bowls to indoor dust, it’s wild how many small things add up.</p>

<p>Here’s the new post if you’re curious:</p>

<p>👉 [<a href="https://ecofurball.com/reduce-microplastics-in-your-pets-routine/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ecofurball.com/reduce-microplastics-in-your-pets-routine/</a>]</p>

<p>From a project-building perspective, this piece was fun because it touched multiple parts of the workflow:</p>

<p>researching a topic where pet care overlaps with environmental science</p>

<p>writing with clarity but avoiding the “SEO robot voice”</p>

<p>creating multiple images and matching schemas</p>

<p>and making sure the whole thing fits into the content structure I’ve been evolving over the last couple of months</p>

<p>The more I work on EcoFurball, the more I realise that keeping the site healthy isn’t just about writing articles — it’s about maintaining the workflow behind them: backlinks, fresh posts, image prep, schemas, and the whole publishing pipeline.</p>

<p>If you’re working on a side project too — whether it’s dev-focused or content-focused — I’d love to hear:<br>
How do you keep your project moving forward when you only have small pockets of time each week?</p>

<p>Always open to hearing how other creators balance consistency with everything else in life.</p>
