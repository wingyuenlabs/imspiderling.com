<h2>
  
  
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>The freelance economy is booming, but it’s still plagued by age-old problems: delayed payments, lack of trust, and the constant need to chase invoices. What if you could work with the certainty that your funds are already secured and will be released automatically as you work?</p>

<p>Enter <strong>Massa Freelance</strong>, a new decentralized application (dApp) built on the <strong>Massa Blockchain</strong>. We are redefining the relationship between clients and freelancers by leveraging <strong>Autonomous Smart Contracts</strong> to guarantee transparency, security, and real-time payments.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why Massa Freelance?
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  1. Verified Proof of Funds
</h3>

<p>Never work for free again. With our platform, clients lock funds into a smart contract before the work begins. As a freelancer, you can verify the contract's balance in real-time, ensuring the money is there and ready for you.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  2. Autonomous Payments
</h3>

<p>Forget about net-30 payment terms. Massa's unique <strong>Autonomous Smart Contracts</strong> can wake themselves up and execute transactions automatically. This means you can get paid by the hour, the minute, or any interval you choose—without the client needing to manually click "send" every time.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  3. Total Flexibility
</h3>

<p>Whether you are hiring talent or looking for work, our platform offers ultimate flexibility. The interface is built with <strong>Next.js</strong> and styled with a clean, modern aesthetic (using a fresh green palette instead of the standard crypto-purple!), making it accessible to everyone, not just web3 natives.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Under the Hood
</h2>

<p>We've built Massa Freelance using a robust modern stack:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Frontend:</strong> Next.js 15 with React 19</li>
<li>  <strong>Blockchain:</strong> <code>@massalabs/massa-web3</code> and AssemblyScript contracts</li>
<li>  <strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM</li>
<li>  <strong>Styling:</strong> Tailwind CSS with a custom design system</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  How We Use @[.kiro]
</h2>

<p>One of the secret weapons in our development workflow is <strong><code>.kiro</code></strong>. You might have noticed this directory in our project root. It serves as the "steering wheel" and "brain" for our AI coding assistant.</p>

<p>The <code>.kiro</code> directory allows us to define project-specific context and rules that the AI must follow. It contains two key subdirectories:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong><code>settings/</code></strong>: This holds configuration files like <code>mcp.json</code>, which defines the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> servers our AI uses. This connects our AI to external tools, such as Chrome DevTools or database connectors, giving it superpowers beyond just reading code.</li>
<li>  <strong><code>steering/</code></strong>: This is where we keep our "constitution." It contains Markdown files with specific instructions, such as <code>ui color prefer non purple primary.md</code>. These files tell the AI exactly how we want our code written—from UI color preferences (we strictly prefer greens and teals over purple) to coding conventions.</li>
</ul>

<p>By using <code>.kiro</code>, we ensure that every line of code generated by the AI aligns perfectly with our project's unique style and architectural decisions, effectively "customizing" the AI to be a perfect teammate for <strong>Massa Freelance</strong>.</p>

  🛠️ Developer Guide: Deploying &amp; Interacting with Smart Contracts
</h2>

<p>Want to run this yourself? Here is how we handle the smart contract lifecycle in <strong>Massa Freelance</strong>.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  1. The Autonomous Smart Contract (<code>assembly/contracts/autonomous.ts</code>)
</h3>

<p>The heart of our system is the <code>autonomous.ts</code> contract. Unlike traditional smart contracts that are passive (waiting for an external transaction to trigger them), this contract is <strong>active</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Self-Scheduling:</strong> The <code>sendCoinsAutonomously</code> function performs a payment and then <em>immediately schedules its next execution</em> using <code>deferredCallRegister</code>. This creates an infinite loop of payments that runs entirely on-chain without any off-chain "keeper" or cron job.</li>
<li>  <strong>State Management:</strong> We use a simple state machine (<code>RUNNING</code> / <code>STOPPED</code>) to control the flow. The <code>start</code> function kicks off the loop, and <code>stop</code> breaks it.</li>
<li>  <strong>Safety:</strong> The contract checks its own balance before every execution to ensure it can cover both the payment and the storage fees for the next scheduled call.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  2. Compiling &amp; Deploying
</h3>

<p>We use a set of custom scripts defined in our <code>package.json</code> to streamline the process.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Compile to WASM</strong><br>
First, we compile our AssemblyScript code into WebAssembly (WASM) bytecode that the Massa blockchain can understand.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>npm run build:autonomous
<span class="c"># Runs: asc assembly/contracts/autonomous.ts --outFile build/autonomous.wasm --optimize --runtime stub</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Step 2: Deploy to Buildnet</strong><br>
Next, we deploy the compiled WASM to the Massa Buildnet. We use a dedicated deployment script (<code>assembly/deploy_autonomous.ts</code>) that handles the wallet connection and constructor arguments.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>npm run deploy:autonomous
<span class="c"># Runs: bun assembly/deploy_autonomous.ts</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><em>Note: Make sure you have your <code>WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY</code> set in your <code>.env</code> file!</em></p>

<h3>
  
  
  3. Interacting with the Contract
</h3>

<p>Once deployed, the contract is in a <code>STOPPED</code> state. To start the autonomous payment stream, we need to call the <code>start</code> function.</p>

<p>We've created a helper script for this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>npm run call:autonomous-start
<span class="c"># Runs: bun scripts/call_autonomous_start.ts</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This script:</p>

<ol>
<li> Connects to the blockchain using your private key.</li>
<li> Targets your specific contract address.</li>
<li> Sends a transaction to execute the <code>start</code> method.</li>
<li> Monitors the execution to ensure it started successfully.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that's it! Your contract is now alive, waking itself up at every interval to pay your freelancer. 🚀</p>
