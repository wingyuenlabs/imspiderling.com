<p>Predator 2, the 1990 sequel to the Schwarzenegger-led original, takes the Predator out of the jungle and drops Danny Glover into an L.A. heatwave and crime spree—complete with Gary Busey doing his thing—and pits him against an even more lethal alien hunter.</p>

<p>It might skimp on a couple of the first film’s classic beats, but if you’re up for a fresh urban spin (and don’t expect a scene-for-scene replay of the 1987 smash), you’ll find Predator 2 to be a fun, wild ride.</p>
