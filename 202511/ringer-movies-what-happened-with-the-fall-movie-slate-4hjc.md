<p>Sean, Amanda and Van Lathan roast this fall’s underwhelming movie lineup before breaking down Edgar Wright’s ‘The Running Man’—a gloriously messy action spectacle powered by Glen Powell’s charm. Then, they dive into ‘Now You See Me: Now You Don’t,’ praising Rosamund Pike’s evil diamond heiress and guessing how this magic legacy sequel might fare at the box office.</p>
