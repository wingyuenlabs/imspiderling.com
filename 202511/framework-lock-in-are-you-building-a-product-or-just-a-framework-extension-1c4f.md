<p>Ever looked at code that feels more like a <strong>framework demo</strong> than a real product?</p>

<p>Many teams proudly say: “We’ve built an independent product.”<br><br>
But when you dig deeper, you realize everything — from routing to authentication — is tightly bound to the framework.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why is this a problem?
</h2>

<p>In that scenario, your product has <strong>no independent identity</strong>.<br><br>
If the framework gets deprecated tomorrow or the team shifts direction, you’ll end up <strong>rewriting everything from scratch</strong>.  </p>

<p>That’s the danger of <strong>Framework Lock-In</strong>.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  The trade-off
</h2>

<p>On the flip side, some teams intentionally give up freedom for <strong>development speed</strong> and <strong>community support</strong>.<br><br>
Fair enough… but is that truly a <strong>strategy</strong>, or just <strong>convenience disguised as one</strong>?</p>




<h2>
  
  
  What often gets forgotten
</h2>

<p>A real product should have its <strong>own architectural identity</strong>.<br><br>
A framework should remain a <strong>tool</strong>, not the thing that defines your product.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The uncomfortable truth: many so-called “products” are really just framework extensions.</p>
</blockquote>




<h3>
  
  
  Question
</h3>

<p>Would your product survive without the framework,<br><br>
or is it just a plug-in living on top of it?</p>




<p><strong>What do you think?</strong><br><br>
Have you ever refactored a system that was too tied to its framework?</p>
