<p>Everything Wrong With The Fantastic Four: First Steps In 20 Minutes Or Less is a Cinema Sins video that gleefully points out every nitpick and “sin” in the new Fantastic Four movie—drops a few jokes, spoils some moments, and ultimately declares it “sintastic” rather than outright terrible. It kicks off with a shout-out to sponsor BetterHelp (discount link included), because even sin-counting can be stressful.</p>

<p>On top of the main feature, Cinema Sins plugs their website, Linktree for all the latest updates, YouTube channels (@TVSins, @commercialsins, @cinemasinspodcastnetwork), a sinful viewer poll, Patreon support, and social hangouts (Discord, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok). Writers Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian, and Daniel all get a nod in the credits.</p>
