<p>Hey everyone! 👋</p>

<p>I’m excited to share ZipperOS, a modern Linux distribution I’ve been developing. It’s built to evolve based on user feedback — the community helps decide what features get added next.</p>

<p>What’s available now:</p>

<p>Download the latest ISO and try ZipperOS today: Archive.org ISO</p>

<p>Explore the ZipperOS Fandom page zipperos.bettermode.io<br>
 for updates, screenshots, and community discussions</p>

<p>Full documentation and guides on the official site</p>

<p>Why ZipperOS?<br>
It’s designed to listen to its users. Every suggestion counts — your input helps shape the OS.</p>

<p>I’d love feedback, ideas, and thoughts on what people want from a Linux OS!</p>

<p>— Wolfie</p>
