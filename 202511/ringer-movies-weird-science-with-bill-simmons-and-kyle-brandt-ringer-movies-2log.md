<p><strong>Weird Science</strong> gets the Rewatchables treatment as Bill Simmons and Kyle Brandt revisit John Hughes’s 1985 cult classic, diving into Anthony Michael Hall’s geek squad, Kelly LeBrock’s AI goddess and Ilan Mitchell-Smith’s teen rebellion. Expect a nostalgic trip through all the film’s funniest, quirkiest moments.</p>

<p>They chat sex, drugs, rock ’n’ roll—and yes, chips, dips, chains and whips—while unpacking why this movie still rules 35+ years later. Don’t miss the episode (brought to you by State Farm) and be sure to subscribe to The Ringer’s channels for more deep-dives.</p>
