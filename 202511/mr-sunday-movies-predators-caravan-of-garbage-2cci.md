  Predators – Caravan of Garbage TL;DR
</h1>

<p>Mr Sunday Movies digs into <strong>Predators</strong> (2010), celebrating how it finally brought the franchise back to its pulpy roots: rag-tag lunatics dropped into a muddy jungle hunt and a gritty showdown that (mostly) outshines the Alien vs Predator missteps. He loves the fresh twists, mourns that we never got a proper follow-up, and wishes the action train had kept rolling.</p>

<p>Along the way you get all the usual plug-fest goodies—early vids on bigsandwich.co, bonus podcasts, Twitter shout-outs, merch links and more—so if you’re into more rambling takes, commentary tracks and sweet Predator tees, you know where to go.</p>
