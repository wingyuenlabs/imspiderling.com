<p>After yesterday's breakdown, didn't expect much from today. But here we are.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The DBMS Exam
</h2>

<p>Monday. The exam I didn't study for because I lost Day F5 completely.</p>

<p>Walked in expecting to bomb it. Genuinely thought I was about to fail.</p>

<p>Three hour exam. I was done in one hour.</p>

<p>Just... wrote what I knew, didn't overthink it, got out of there. Probably pulled a B-. Maybe B if I'm lucky. Either way, not the disaster I expected.</p>

<p>Sometimes your brain just pulls through when you least expect it. Or maybe I absorbed more from those half-focused study sessions than I thought. Who knows.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Straight to the Gym
</h2>

<p>Finished the exam early. Didn't go to my room. Went straight to the gym.</p>

<p>Leg and shoulder day. The kind that usually destroys you.</p>

<p>And I lifted well. Actually well. Not struggling, not barely getting through it—I was strong today.</p>

<p>After yesterday when I couldn't lift what I normally do and hated myself for it, today felt like proof I'm not completely falling apart.</p>

<p>Body still works. Mind still works. Just had to show up.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Founder Connections
</h2>

<p>Also connected with some founders today. Tech people, startup people. Haven't had real conversations yet but the connection's there.</p>

<p>And it reminded me of something I keep forgetting: this is what I'm good at.</p>

<p>Not relationships. Not friendships. Not the normal social stuff that everyone else seems to figure out easily.</p>

<p>I'm good at tech. At understanding what people are building. At talking about code and projects and ideas.</p>

<p>That's my lane. That's where I belong.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Realization (Again)
</h2>

<p>I keep coming back to this: I'm good at what I do BECAUSE I'm bad at everything else.</p>

<p>All those hours I didn't spend learning how to be normal? I spent them learning this stuff. The trade-off is real and I can't have both.</p>

<p>So I'm done trying.</p>

<p>Gonna ignore everyone and everything that isn't this. The tech world, the building, the founders, the projects—that's it. That's where my energy goes.</p>

<p>Who cares about the rest? Clearly it doesn't work for me anyway.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Moving Forward
</h2>

<p>Two weeks of exams still ahead. But if I can pull a B- on an exam I thought I'd fail, maybe the rest won't kill me either.</p>

<p>One day at a time. Show up, do the thing, lift heavy, connect with the right people, ignore everything else.</p>

<p>Day F6 is done. And for once, it wasn't a disaster.</p>

<p>Let's keep it going.</p>




<p><em>Sometimes you surprise yourself. Not in a dramatic way, just in a "oh I didn't completely fall apart" way. I'll take it.</em></p>
