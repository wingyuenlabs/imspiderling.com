<p>When I joined my first Hacktoberfest, I was purely a QA.<br>
Now, two years later, I’m still a QA — but in my free time, I’ve become an indie gamedev.<br>
Over these two years, I’ve grown — not just as a professional, but as someone who discovered that open source is truly open for everyone.</p>

<p>At first glance, it might seem like QA specialists don’t have much to do in Hacktoberfest — after all, it’s often seen as a coder’s festival.<br>
But my experience proved the opposite: QA can participate, and make a real impact.</p>

<p><strong>My Contributions</strong></p>

<p>Most of my pull requests went to the <a href="https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books" rel="noopener noreferrer">free-programming-books</a><br>
 repository, which had around 376k stars at the time of writing.<br>
I believe even small changes — like fixing broken links — can help others.<br>
Sometimes, one dead link in documentation can change someone’s entire learning path.</p>

<p>I once found useful materials on <strong>Godot engine</strong> and <strong>GDScript</strong> in that  repository, and now I try to keep it useful for others who are learning just like I did.</p>

<p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>

<p>This year, I got an Supercontributor bage, and even made it into the top 10,000 contributors of Hacktoberfest.<br>
Which, to be honest, came as a surprise to me - it looks like I should get a t-shirt for this now :)</p>

<p>Hacktoberfest taught me that growth isn’t just about writing more code — it’s about helping others learn, improving shared resources, and believing that your contribution counts.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I hope my story inspires those who still hesitate to join.<br>
Even if you’re not a developer in the traditional sense — your work in open source can still make a difference.</p>

<p>So, see you next year — because I’m definitely joining again!</p>
