<p><strong>Predator 2 – Caravan of Garbage</strong><br><br>
Fresh off the first film’s success, this 1990 sequel ditches Schwarzenegger’s jungle for a crime- and heat-soaked L.A., brings in Danny Glover and ups the ante with an even deadlier Predator.</p>

<p>It may lack some of the original’s wilderness vibes, but if you’re cool with a change of scenery, a grittier crime wave and a dash of Gary Busey, it’s a fun, wild ride.</p>
