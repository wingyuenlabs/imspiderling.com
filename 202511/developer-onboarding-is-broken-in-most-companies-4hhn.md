<p>The average new engineer spends 2–3 weeks just figuring out where things are. Not building. Not shipping. Just… searching.</p>

<p>Here’s what actually happens:<br>
→ Documentation is outdated (or nonexistent)<br>
→ Code logic lives in someone’s head<br>
→ Meeting decisions are buried in Slack</p>

<p>The real cost? Each new hire wastes 40–60 hours of senior developer time just asking questions.</p>

<p>How to fix it:</p>

<p>Centralize your knowledge in one place</p>

<ol>
<li>Centralize your knowledge in one place</li>
<li>Make your codebase searchable with AI</li>
<li>Auto-document meeting decisions</li>
<li>Link tasks to code changes for context</li>
</ol>

<p>We built <strong><a href="https://syncally.app" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syncally</a></strong> to solve this exact problem. It connects your GitHub, meetings, and tasks so new devs can ask “why was this built this way?” and get instant answers.</p>

<p>No more 3-hour context-hunting sessions. No more bothering your senior devs.</p>

<p>If onboarding takes more than 3 days, your knowledge management is broken.</p>
