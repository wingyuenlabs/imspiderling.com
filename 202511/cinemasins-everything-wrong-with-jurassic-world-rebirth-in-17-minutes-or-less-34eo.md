  Everything Wrong With Jurassic World Rebirth In 17 Minutes Or Less
</h1>

<p>CinemaSins puts Jurassic World Rebirth under the sin-lens, tallying up every dino-fueled plot hole and Hollywood convenience in under 17 minutes. They rib the franchise for bringing the same prehistoric stars back to life, all while cracking jokes and pointing out every ridiculous moment.</p>

<p>Between the snark, they plug their main site (cinemasins.com), Linktree for up-to-date news, a sinful viewer poll, and their Patreon. Writers Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian, and Daniel get shoutouts, plus there are invites to join their Discord and Reddit communities, follow on Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, or even grab Jeremy’s new book.</p>
