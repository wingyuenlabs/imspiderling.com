<p>Recently, I posted my "Event-Driven AI" experiment. I presented it as a "Rules Engine," but I've realized that was just scratching the surface.</p>

<p>After playing with it more, I just unlocked its real potential. 🤯 </p>

<p>The video shows at first, a simple to-do app.<br>
But by changing a single prompt (no code!), the app instantly becomes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Recipe Todo App (generating ingredients)</li>
<li>A Trip Todo App (generating a packing list)</li>
<li>A "Whatever-you-want" App</li>
</ul>

<p>I realized I wasn't just building a "rules engine." I was building a "<strong>Generative UI Engine.</strong>" 🤯 🤯 </p>

<p>The LLM acts as a new layer of abstraction. Instead of me, the developer, hard-coding every feature, I just give the AI a "Swiss knife" of tools (like addTitle, addItem, setCounter).</p>

<p>The AI then uses these tools to build whatever the user wants, not just what the developer had in mind.</p>

<p>It's a shift from "Here are the 3 features I built for you" to "<strong>What do you want to accomplish?</strong>" 🤯 🤯 🤯 </p>

<p>Yes, there are drawbacks (performance, determinism). But the potential for truly dynamic, user-centric applications is HUGE. This is the discovery that has me excited.</p>

<p>And the best part? I got this working in just a few hours, on the first try.</p>
