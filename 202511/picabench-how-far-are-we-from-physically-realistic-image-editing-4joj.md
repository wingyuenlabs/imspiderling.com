  Can AI Make Photo Edits Look Totally Real?
</h3>

<p>Ever wondered why a removed object sometimes leaves a ghostly shadow behind? <strong>Scientists have built</strong> a new test called PICABench to see how close today’s AI tools are to fixing those invisible details.<br>
 Imagine editing a photo like swapping a car for a bike – the magic should also erase the car’s reflection on the road and the tiny dust it kicked up.<br>
 That’s the kind of <strong>physical realism</strong> PICABench checks, from light tricks to tiny movements.<br>
 The researchers even taught a computer to learn these tricks from real videos, creating a huge “PICA‑100K” library of examples.<br>
 After putting popular editing apps through the test, they found most still miss the mark – shadows linger, reflections stay, and objects look out of place.<br>
 It’s a reminder that while AI can follow our instructions, making a scene feel truly natural is still a work in progress.<br>
 One day, every photo edit might be so seamless you’ll never notice the edit at all.<br>
 <strong>Stay tuned</strong> for the next leap in realistic image editing!</p>

<p>The future of pictures is brighter – and more believable – than ever.<br>
