<h1>
  
  
  TL;DR
</h1>

<p>CinemaSins just dropped their “Everything Wrong With Thunderbolts* (The New Avengers) In 20 Minutes Or Less” video, where they rack up all the movie’s “sins” while confessing it’s kinda great anyway. Expect their trademark snark, rapid-fire critiques and a surprising soft spot for the film.</p>

<p>They also pepper the description with links to their main site, socials (TVSins, CommercialSins, TikTok, Instagram, Discord, Reddit), a fan poll, Patreon support, and shout-outs to the writers behind the video. Don’t miss out on bonus content and behind-the-scenes chatter over at CinemaSins.com!</p>
