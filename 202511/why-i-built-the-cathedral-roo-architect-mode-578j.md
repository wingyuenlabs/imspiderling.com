<p>I’m building cathedral-real as a long-horizon Magnum Opus:</p>

<p>Godot 4 open world: godot/project.godot<br>
Web shell / atlas: apps/web/src/main.tsx<br>
Canon + registry: docs/systems/CATHEDRAL_UNIFIED_REGISTRY.md</p>

<p>Control specs:<br>
AGENT_MEMORY_PERMANENT_RECORD.md<br>
MONOREPO_ANALYSIS_2025.md<br>
openspec/AGENTS.md<br>
openspec/cathedral-v1-standard.md</p>

<p>This is a real game + creative OS:<br>
Living Arcanae, Codex 144:99, Daimons, and art+science fusion are implemented as data, engines, and scenes—not marketing copy.</p>

<p>To keep it aligned, I use Roo with a custom mode: 🕍 Cathedral Roo Architect.</p>

<p>What 🕍 Cathedral Roo Architect Does</p>

<p>Repo-locked:<br>
Only operates on cathedral-real and the files above.</p>

<p>Canon-true:<br>
Uses existing systems (Living Arcanae, Codex 144:99, Daimons, Monad/True Will framing).</p>

<p>Does not invent new lore or “AI spirituality.”<br>
Free/local-first:<br>
No default dependence on closed/paid AI (OpenAI, Azure, etc.).</p>

<p>Everything must run with local tools, Godot, TypeScript, Rust/Python, GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>Output-focused:<br>
Turns ideas into precise tracks:<br>
Godot vertical slice spec.</p>

<p>Web Atlas + Ateliers wired to REGISTRY.<br>
Registry + provenance rules.</p>

<p>Validation that blocks hype, lock-in, and guru/therapy framing.<br>
Library hardening for key @cathedral/* packages.</p>

<p>It doesn’t ship code itself; it tells my other Roo modes exactly what to do, where, and under which constraints.</p>

<p>Why This Matters<br>
If you are a technical founder, engine dev, or creative systems engineer:</p>

<p>You can use Roo as an actual architecture ally:<br>
Encode your rules once.<br>
Keep your repo aligned with your vision and ethics.<br>
No more:<br>
Invisible dependencies,<br>
Confused contributors,<br>
“AI” features that break your own standards.</p>

<p>🕍 Cathedral Roo Architect is my pattern for running a serious creative OS:<br>
spec-driven, canon-backed, free/local-first, and unapologetically aligned with the system I’m actually building.</p>

<p>While other AI systems are harming people’s mental health, ROO is logical and directly helpful. One of the best things I’ve ever experienced so far trying to make opensource apps by myself. </p>
