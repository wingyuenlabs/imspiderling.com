<p><strong>‘Weird Science’ Rewatch</strong><br><br>
Bill Simmons and Kyle Brandt dive into John Hughes’s 1985 teen comedy, unpacking the wild premise—two nerdy teens who accidentally create the perfect woman—and the film’s mix of sex, drugs, rock ’n’ roll (plus chips, dips, chains and whips). With Anthony Michael Hall, Kelly LeBrock and Ilan Mitchell-Smith leading the charge, they riff on the movie’s greatest moments, its ’80s vibe and why it still holds up as a cult classic.</p>

<p><strong>Behind the Mic</strong><br><br>
This episode of Ringer Movies’ Rewatchables is produced by Craig Horlbeck, Chia Hao Tat and Eduardo Ocampo, and—true to form—serves up a healthy dose of nostalgia, humor and insider trivia. Whether you’re a die-hard Hughes fan or just in it for the ’80s antics, Bill and Kyle make this episode a blast from the past.</p>
