<p>I'm publishing content generated by ChatGPT to my website:<br>
<a href="https://damien.house/practice/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://damien.house/practice/</a></p>

<p>It summarizes work I did between 2006 and 2012 to create a research and development practice for software development.</p>

<p>I began by asking Gemini how to approach my prompt strategy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are some good ways to customize the "Configure Chat" dialog box in NotebookLLM ? I've set "Define your conversational goal, style, or role" to Custom, so I can customize the chat. I want to tell it to use "warm and collaborative tone", that it's role in our chat is that of an executive coach for leaders in the software engineering field, that I'm a leader in software engineering, and that the role they fill is that of a coach, advisor, and assistant to me. it would be nice to use the same settings across NotebookLLM, ChatGPT, and Claude as they all have this feature.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>I had a similar plan in mind in using NotebookLLM as more of a document generator (it produced the briefing doc and strategic plan that I later added to ChatGPT).</p>

<p>I found an issue though in using this plan in Claude.  The dialog didn't include any mention of the roles I had created.  I didn't spend much time debugging or tweaking so I didn't have time to make it work.  I left it out of my process in the end.</p>

<p>I focused on using ChatGPT for this chat.</p>
