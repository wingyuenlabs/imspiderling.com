  Everything Wrong With The Wiz In 15 Minutes Or Less
</h1>

<p>CinemaSins is back down the yellow brick road, cracking open 1978’s The Wiz and tallying up all the “sins” you never noticed—especially now that Wicked’s back in theaters. In just about fifteen minutes, they poke fun at plot holes, quirky musical numbers, and everything in between to see if this Oz spin-off holds up—or if it’s more of a wicked disappointment.</p>

<p>Along the way, they plug their site and social channels (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Discord, Reddit), invite you to fill out their “sinful” viewer poll, and drop links to their linktree and Patreon. Shout-outs go to writers Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian, and Daniel—plus Jeremy’s new book. If you love nitpicking movies as much as they do, you know where to join the fun.</p>
