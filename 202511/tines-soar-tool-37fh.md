<p>In recent times, I have been working in Tines as we have shifted to this platform for our SOAR needs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tines SOAR is a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response platform that uses a no-code/low-code interface to help security teams automate and manage security workflows, making them faster and more efficient. It integrates with various security tools through an API-centric approach, allowing it to automate tasks like responding to alerts, triaging incidents, and enriching threat intelligence data</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been enjoying using this tool a great deal as it allows a lot of flexibility and comes with a large number of built-in integrations.</p>

<p>Tines also has great performance as I have noted that the platform can run actions in parallel which reduces run time as compared to some other SOAR products.</p>

<p>Using Tines, I have been able to automate 50 hours (and counting) of security work so that security engineers can spend time on more value added projects.</p>

<p>As part of my learning on this platform I have completed both the Tines Core Certification as well as the Tines Advanced Certification.</p>

<p>These certifications contain a number of pre-labs which contain a lot of good hands-on material and tips and creates to create robust/efficient stories.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to further my knowledge/skills on the platform in order to increase efficiencies via automation!</p>
