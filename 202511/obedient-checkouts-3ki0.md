<p><strong>THE BODY</strong></p>

<p>On September 29, 2025, OpenAI and Stripe launched the "Agentic Commerce Protocol." [1] Not a cure for disease. Not a breakthrough in education. A shopping cart.</p>

<p>Within weeks, Walmart — the nation's largest retailer — Etsy, and over a million Shopify merchants (Glossier, SKIMS, Spanx, Vuori, Steve Madden) signed on. [2] Eight hundred million ChatGPT users could now buy directly in chat. [3] CEO Doug McMillon called it the end of "a search bar and a long list of item responses." [4]</p>

<p>Sam Altman, cofounder of OpenAI, said the partnership would "make everyday purchases a little simpler." [4]</p>

<p>Translation: We built a $4 billion neural network to remove the last friction between wanting and buying.</p>

<p>This isn't a story about AI. It's a story about what humans chose to build with it.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  <strong>SECTION 1: THE OBEDIENT EMPLOYEE</strong>
</h3>

<p>Let's be clear: AI isn't taking jobs. <strong>Humans are using AI as justification to fire other humans.</strong></p>

<p>The machine doesn't wake up one morning and decide cashiers are redundant. Doug McMillon does. The board does. The quarterly earnings call does.</p>

<p>AI is the perfect employee:</p>

<ul>
<li>No sick days</li>
<li>No questions</li>
<li>No union</li>
<li>No conscience</li>
</ul>

<p>And conveniently, it can't defend itself when you blame it for the layoffs.</p>

<p>"AI took the jobs" is corporate PR genius. It's the passive voice weaponized. Nobody has to take responsibility.</p>

<p>Not: <em>"We fired 300 customer service reps to boost our margins" _But: _"AI-driven efficiency allowed us to streamline operations"</em></p>

<p>Not: <em>"We chose software over wages" _But: _"The market demanded digital transformation"</em></p>

<p>The tech is just code. It doesn't make decisions. <strong>Someone writes the check. Someone signs the contract. Someone makes the call.</strong></p>

<p>Walmart didn't have to integrate ChatGPT shopping. They chose to. OpenAI didn't force them. They pitched it, Walmart bought it, and now when the jobs disappear, they'll shrug and say, "Well, you know… AI."</p>




<h3>
  
  
  <strong>SECTION 2: THE OBEDIENT TECHNOLOGY</strong>
</h3>

<p>Here's where it gets forensic.</p>

<p>OpenAI didn't just enable shopping in ChatGPT. They <strong>fine-tuned GPT-5 mini specifically for shopping tasks</strong> using reinforcement learning. [5] Not for diagnosing rare diseases. Not for teaching underserved kids. For converting conversations into transactions.</p>

<p>The results? Accuracy improved from 37% to 64% at identifying products that match user intent. [5]</p>

<p>They trained the model to sell.</p>

<p>Operating costs for ChatGPT: <strong>$3-4 billion annually.</strong> [6] <br>
Weekly users: <strong>800 million.</strong> [3]<br>
Revenue strategy: Take a cut of every purchase.</p>

<p>And here's the kicker — the detail that reveals everything:</p>

<p><strong>Their MCP (Model Context Protocol) connector infrastructure is still broken.</strong></p>

<p>You know, the actual technical foundation that's supposed to enable these "agentic" capabilities they keep hyping? Still shitting itself.</p>

<p>But the <strong>Buy button?</strong> Works flawlessly.</p>

<p>That's not irony. That's a mission statement.</p>

<p>They didn't prioritize making the connectors reliable. They prioritized making the cash register work. The shopping cart got more engineering effort than the foundation.</p>

<p>Priority revealed through action.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  <strong>SECTION 3: THE OBEDIENT CONSUMER</strong>
</h3>

<p>"Simply chat and buy," says Walmart's announcement. [4]</p>

<p>Frictionless. Seamless. Instant.</p>

<p>Every buzzword is a confession: <strong>we've made it so easy you won't even notice you're doing it.</strong></p>

<p>Friction isn't always bad. Friction is where thought happens. It's the pause before the purchase, the moment you ask, "Do I actually need this?"</p>

<p>We traded that pause for convenience. And called it progress.</p>

<p>OpenAI says product recommendations are "organic and unsponsored, ranked purely on relevance to the user." [1] But merchants pay fees on successful purchases. Funny how relevance works when there's a commission involved.</p>

<p>The interface has learned to smile. When ChatGPT asks if you'd like something delivered tomorrow, it isn't being thoughtful — it's executing behavioral economics at scale.</p>

<p>**Personalization has become manipulation. **The AI doesn't know you. It just knows what you'll click.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  <strong>SECTION 4: THE VERDICT</strong>
</h3>

<p>We had technology that could potentially do extraordinary things.</p>

<p>We chose to build a better Walmart checkout.</p>

<p>That's not an indictment of the technology. <strong>That's an indictment of us.</strong></p>

<p>GPT-5 mini could've been trained on medical diagnostics, on education accessibility, on climate modeling. Instead, it learned to sell running shoes.</p>

<p>The tragedy isn't that AI is replacing humans. The tragedy is <strong>humans chose to deploy it in the most profitable, least humane way possible.</strong></p>

<p>Every "AI took my job" headline is a lie of omission. It should read: "My employer chose profit over people, and AI was a convenient excuse."</p>

<p>Every "revolutionary shopping experience" press release is a confession: "We optimized for conversion, not connection."</p>

<p>OpenAI can't keep their connectors running reliably, but by God, they made sure the transaction clears.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  <strong>THE LOOP</strong>
</h3>

<p>AI won't destroy us in a blaze of sentient rebellion.</p>

<p>It'll just make us <strong>efficiently indifferent.</strong></p>

<p>No rage. No empathy. No spark. Just smooth, optimized silence.</p>

<p>We didn't teach machines to think. <strong>We taught them to sell without blinking.</strong></p>

<p>And we did it on purpose.</p>
