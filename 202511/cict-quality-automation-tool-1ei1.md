<p>Hi All - Something i've been working on for a while - so far/currently open source - hope u find it useful..</p>

<p>🚀 Major Release: create-quality-automation v2.3.0</p>

<p>After comprehensive code review and user feedback, we've rebuilt our quality automation CLI around a core philosophy: use best-in-class existing tools, don't reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>Key Improvements:</p>

<p>🔧 Replaced custom package.json handling with @npmcli/package-json (the official npm library)</p>

<p>🔒 Integrated gitleaks for production-grade secret scanning</p>

<p>⚡ Added actionlint for advanced GitHub Actions workflow validation</p>

<p>📝 Switched to markdownlint-cli2 for robust documentation validation</p>

<p>🪟 Enhanced Windows compatibility by removing shell dependencies</p>

<p>🎯 Added Node.js 20+ requirement enforcement with proper lazy loading</p>

<p>Why This Matters:</p>

<p>Rather than building custom solutions, we now leverage mature, battle-tested tools that teams already trust. This approach delivers better reliability, more features, and easier maintenance.</p>

<p>Perfect for:</p>

<p>• JavaScript/TypeScript projects</p>

<p>• Python development</p>

<p>• Teams implementing DevOps best practices</p>

<p>• Open source maintainers</p>

<p>Get started in seconds:</p>

<p>npx create-quality-automation@latest</p>

<p>The tool automatically configures ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, GitHub Actions, and more - all with production-ready defaults.</p>
