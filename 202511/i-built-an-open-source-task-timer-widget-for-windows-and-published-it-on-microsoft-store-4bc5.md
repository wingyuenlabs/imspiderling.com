<p>Hi everyone! 👋  </p>

<p>I'm Melih — a software engineer, author, and composer from Türkiye.<br><br>
Recently, I built a small <strong>open-source Windows widget</strong> to help me (and hopefully others) stay focused on their current task.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  🕓 What It Does
</h2>

<p>The app simply shows <strong>what you’re currently working on</strong> and <strong>how long you’ve been on it</strong> — right on your desktop.<br><br>
It’s minimal, always visible, and helps you track time without switching windows.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🛠️ Built With
</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>C# + WinUI 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>MVVM pattern</strong></li>
<li>Local data persistence (no online sync, everything stays on your PC)</li>
<li>Lightweight design with almost zero CPU usage
</li>
</ul>

<p>I wanted something that runs natively on Windows, blends in visually, and doesn’t distract me — so I decided to build it myself.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🪟 Available on Microsoft Store
</h2>

<p>You can now download it directly from the Microsoft Store:<br><br>

<p>And of course, it’s <strong>open source</strong>:<br><br>
🔗 <a href="https://github.com/melihcelenk/TaskTimerWidget" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Repository</a></p>




<h2>
  
  
  💡 Why I Built It
</h2>

<p>I used many productivity tools (ActivityWatch, WakaTime, etc.), but I wanted something that stays <strong>always visible</strong> and shows <strong>just one thing: what I’m doing right now</strong>.  </p>

<p>This small widget helps me stay mindful of my current focus — especially while coding or composing music.</p>




<p>Thanks for reading!<br><br>
If you try it out, I’d love to hear your feedback — both on the app and the code.  </p>

<p>Stay focused! 💻🎵  </p>
