<p><strong>Best Picture Power Rankings &amp; the Super-Sincerity of ‘Sentimental Value’</strong> kicks off with Sean and Amanda breaking down the looming Warner Brothers Discovery sale—tossing around potential mergers with Paramount, Comcast or Netflix—before moving on to their baffled take on Colleen Hoover’s new adaptation, <em>Regretting You</em>. They then dig into Joachim Trier’s <em>Sentimental Value</em>, debating why some viewers are moved to tears while others just aren’t feeling it.</p>

<p>In the final segment, Trier himself joins the conversation to reveal how much of his own story is stitched into Stellan Skarsgård’s character, why being a keen observer fuels great character work, and the memorable experience of filming in the very neighborhood he grew up in.</p>
