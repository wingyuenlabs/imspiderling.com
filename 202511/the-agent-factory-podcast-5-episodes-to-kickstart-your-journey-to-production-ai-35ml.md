<p>We are so proud to announce that a project we're incredibly passionate about has grown into a full-blown resource for developers: The Agent Factory video podcast.</p>

<p>We started this show with a simple mission: to have the conversations developers need to be having about AI agents development. We wanted to move past the hype and focus on what really matters—building production-ready AI agents.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, and we have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIivdWyY5sqLXR1eSkiM5bE6pFlXC-OSs" rel="noopener noreferrer">14 episodes</a> published covering everything from architecture patterns to end to end vibe coding of advanced AI applications. To celebrate, we’re sharing our first 5 foundational episodes with the Dev.to community. If you are just starting to build agents or looking to harden your existing systems, this is the perfect place to start.</p>

<p><strong>What to Expect:</strong><br>
We pack every episode with three core segments designed for developers:</p>

<p>🎙️ <strong>Agent Industry Pulse:</strong> We filter the noise and bring you the latest news you actually need to know.</p>

<p>🛠️ <strong>The Factory Floor:</strong> A technical deep-dive where we get our hands dirty with code, architectures, and patterns.</p>

<p>❓ <strong>Developer Q&amp;A:</strong> We answer real questions from the community to help us learn together.</p>

<p>📺 <strong>The Starter Pack: Our First 5 Episodes</strong><br>
Here is the chronological journey to get you up to speed, starting from the very beginning.</p>

<p><strong>1. Agents, their frameworks and when to use them (ft. Julia Wiesinger)</strong> <br>
We kicked things off by tackling the big questions: What exactly is an agent? How do you choose between frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, or the Agent Development Kit (ADK)? We were joined by Julia Wiesinger from the ADK team to guide us through building for production. <iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aLYrV61rJG4">

<p><strong>2. Multi-Agent Systems: Concepts &amp; Patterns</strong><br>
Single agent or multi-agent? In this episode, we break down the architectural patterns that matter - from Supervisors to Swarms. We discuss exactly when you should transition from a single agent to a team of agents to handle complexity and improve reliability. <iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGNScswE0kU">

<p><strong>3. Building Custom Tools for Agents</strong><br>
Agents are only as good as the tools they can use. We dive into Model Context Protocol (MCP), function calling, and how to build secure, authenticated tools that let your agents interact with the real world safely. <iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NiLb5DK4_rU">

<p><strong>4. Memory in Agents (ft. Kimberly Milam)</strong><br>
How do you stop your agent from acting like a goldfish? We chat with Kimberly Milam about implementing long-term memory, managing state, and the "Memory Bank" concept to create personalized experiences that persist across sessions. <iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2yW7aTfjo88">

<p><strong>5. Tackling the Hardest Questions (ft. Philipp Schmidt)</strong><br>
We sat down with Philipp Schmidt from Google DeepMind for a masterclass on the agent development workflow. We cover context engineering, evaluation strategies, and pro-tips for using the Gemini CLI to speed up your development cycle. <iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kPVZQ3ae7-8">
