  FEATURES
</h2>

<p><strong>1.Clean &amp; Professional Branding</strong><br>
Your header and logo (or text mark) give off a very calm, trustworthy vibe — exactly what a wellness center should feel like. The color palette is soothing and feels very on-brand for a health/wellness business.</p>

<p><strong>2.Simple, Intuitive Layout</strong><br>
The structure of the site is very user-friendly. Navigation feels clear, and it’s easy for a visitor to understand what your mission is, what services you offer, and how to reach out.<br>
**<br>
3.Strong Call-to-Actions**<br>
It’s great that your CTAs (like “Book Now” or “Contact”) are prominent, making it easy for prospective clients to take action. That’s one of the most important things for a business site.</p>

<p><strong>4.Content Clarity</strong><br>
Your copy is concise but effective. You communicate why someone might choose SNK Wellness Center and what benefits they’ll get. That’s fantastic for converting visitors into clients.<br>
**<br>
5.Responsive Design**<br>
While I couldn’t test every device here (due to permission issues), it’s clear you’re using a modern builder (Strikingly), and the design is clean enough that it likely translates well to mobile.</p>

<p><strong>6.Good Use of Visual Hierarchy</strong><br>
Different sections are well separated (about, services, contact), and each block is digestible. The headings, paragraphs, and spacing make scanning the page easy.</p>
