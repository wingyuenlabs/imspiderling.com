  TL;DR

<p>CinemaSins just dropped a 20-minute roast of Thunderbolts (aka The New Avengers), pointing out every plot wrinkle and nitpick—yet they still kinda dig the flick. Beyond the sin tally, you’ll find links to their other YouTube channels, socials, a fan poll, Patreon support, and all the usual CinemaSins goodies.</p>

<p>Writers Jeremy, Chris, Aaron, Jonathan, Deneé, Ian, and Daniel bring the snark, and you can connect with them on Twitter, Instagram, Discord, Reddit, TikTok, and more. For the latest updates, check out their Linktree and consider fueling the sin machine on Patreon.</p>
