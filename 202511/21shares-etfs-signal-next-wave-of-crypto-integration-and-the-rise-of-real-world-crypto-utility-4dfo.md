<p>The line between traditional finance and crypto continues to blur.<br>
This week, 21Shares introduced two groundbreaking ETFs — FTSE Crypto 10 (TTOP) and FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC (TXBC) — giving investors regulated exposure to Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and more.</p>

<p>What makes them different isn’t just diversification.<br>
These ETFs are among the first to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, embedding digital assets directly into legacy financial infrastructure.<br>
That means compliance, risk controls, and transparency — something institutions have long demanded from crypto.</p>

<p>But what’s happening in parallel might be even more interesting: crypto usability is scaling up.<br>
As regulated exposure grows, crypto cards like the WhiteBIT Nova Card, Crypto.com Card, and Coinbase Card are becoming real-world payment gateways.<br>
They’re the missing link between DeFi portfolios and coffee-shop payments — a practical bridge connecting blockchain assets with consumer behavior.</p>

<p>Together, institutional products like TTOP and TXBC, combined with real-world tools like crypto cards, are forming a hybrid economy — one where on-chain value moves as freely as fiat.<br>
It’s not just about diversification anymore; it’s about integration.</p>
