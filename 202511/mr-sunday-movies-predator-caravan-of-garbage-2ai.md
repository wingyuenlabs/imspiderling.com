<p>Predator – Caravan of Garbage kicks off a four-week series dissecting the first four Predator movies, starting with Arnie’s 1987 classic. The hosts hail Predator as the ultimate 80s action-sci-fi mash-up, thanks to its spot-on direction, writing, cast, creature design and iconic blend of mud, lasers and explosions.</p>
