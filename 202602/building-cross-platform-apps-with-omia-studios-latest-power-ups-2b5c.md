<p>Since its debut last year, <a href="https://omia.pro" rel="noopener noreferrer">OMIA Studio</a>—the AI-native platform for builders and creatives—has been tearing down walls and making the whole process fun. It’s not just a promise; it’s a reality: a slick, seamless journey from a wild wireframe idea to a polished, production-ready app. </p>

<p>Check out the upgrades that rolled out since January to make building with Python on OMIA Studio an absolute blast.</p>

<p><strong>1. Free Web Deployment: Your Designs Go LIVE!</strong></p>

<p>This is a game-changer. For UI/UX designers, this means your designs can instantly become live web apps for free. Developers, you get rapid deployment of squeaky-clean frontends without the framework headache. You handle the design visually, then dive into the in-built IDE and Python your way to clean functionality.</p>

<p><strong>2. AI Image Generation: Design Magic, On Demand</strong></p>

<p>Need a killer visual but don't want to leave the app? The in-app AI agent can now conjure images for your designs! It’s fast, convenient, and yes, it's available for our Pro-plan users.</p>

<p><strong>3. Google Authentication: Sign-in, Simplified</strong></p>

<p>The Ginni framework, built into the platform, now makes user sign-in a breeze. Drop in the asynchronous <code>google_login()</code> function, and your users can sign in with Google—it returns the user’s authentication details, ready for you to use. Check out the full docs for the deep dive (<a href="https://omia.pro/docs#:~:text=play_recording(media_data.url)-,Google%20Login,-In%20case%20you" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full documentation</a>).</p>

<p>The bottom line? OMIA Studio's intuitive environment lets you write powerful Python with practically zero learning curve. Go build something epic!</p>
