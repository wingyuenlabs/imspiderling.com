<p>Ever wonder how the <em>Wind Waker</em>'s "The Great Sea is Cursed" manages to turn that upbeat adventuring vibe into something genuinely spooky? It's all thanks to some clever musical tricks!</p>

<p>The track deliberately twists the familiar Great Sea theme using jarring tritones, clashing harmonies, and even sneaks in hints of Ganondorf's ominous tune to morph heroic sounds into something truly horrifying. It's a masterclass in creepifying a classic!</p>
