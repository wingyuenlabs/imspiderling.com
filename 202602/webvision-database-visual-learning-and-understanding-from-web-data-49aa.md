  WebVision Database: Millions of web photos teaching computers to see
</h3>

<p>Imagine a giant online photo album used to teach computers what things look like.<br>
 Researchers gathered over <strong>2.<br>
4 million images</strong> from many websites, with short captions and tags, to build a set called WebVision.<br>
 The images are messy, noisy and not perfect but that is the point — those <strong>noisy web photos</strong> help machines learn like they would in the real world.<br>
 Models trained on this pile of pictures often <strong>learns well</strong> and can even do as good or sometimes better when tried on new tasks and new picture collections.<br>
 The work also found a surprise: pictures from different sites carry a kind of <strong>dataset bias</strong>, meaning a model trained on one source may not always match another, so researchers can study how to make learning more fair and robust.<br>
 This is a big step toward teaching computers from everyday web images, with less hand labeling, so future apps could recognize things in the wild more easily then before.</p>
