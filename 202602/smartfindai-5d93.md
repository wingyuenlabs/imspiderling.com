<p>Introducing SmartFind — An AI-Powered Search &amp; Chat Assistant</p>

<p>SmartFind is an AI-powered search and conversational assistant designed to unify product discovery, knowledge lookup, and FAQs into one intelligent experience.</p>

<p>Instead of forcing users to search multiple places separately, SmartFind aggregates results from different data sources (products, articles, and FAQs) and presents them through both a traditional search interface and a chat-style interaction.</p>




<h2>

<li>A clean, developer-friendly architecture</li>
</ul>

<p>Users can type a query like <em>“speaker”</em> or <em>“How do I set up a smart speaker?”</em> and receive structured, meaningful results across multiple content types.</p>
