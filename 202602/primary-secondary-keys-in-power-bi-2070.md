<p>When Keys are mentioned in a <strong>Power Bi</strong> context one cannot help but wonder which is the Primary or Foreign/Secondary key:</p>

<p><strong>A Primary Key</strong> its like a nametag which uniquely identifies a record.<br>
<strong>A foreign Key</strong> its a pointer to another table showing to which primary key it belong to in the other table.</p>

<p>Remember <strong>Power Bi</strong> is a data Modelling tool that works with structured data whose data  is presented in a tabular format.</p>

<p><strong>What is Tabular format</strong> <br>
Its data presented in tables which has rows and columns.</p>

<p>This Tables  below shows the two major Keys one in our facts table and the other in the Dimensional table.</p>

<p>***Facts Table :foreign Keys, or secondary keys as known form the backbone of the fact table and connects tis table to Dimension tables.</p>

<p><strong>Dimension tables</strong>A dimension table is a table that describes something — like customers, products, or dates.</p>

<p>The <strong>primary key</strong> in a dimension table is like a unique ID card for each row. It uniquely identifies each item in the table.</p>
