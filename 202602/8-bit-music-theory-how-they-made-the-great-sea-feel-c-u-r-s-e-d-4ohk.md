<p>Wind Waker's "The Great Sea is Cursed" isn't just a spooky name; it's a full-on musical horror show! It takes the familiar, adventurous Great Sea theme and totally flips it on its head.</p>

<p>This eerie transformation is thanks to clever use of unsettling tritones, clashing notes, and even sneaky nods to Ganondorf's own sinister tune, turning heroism into pure nightmare fuel.</p>
