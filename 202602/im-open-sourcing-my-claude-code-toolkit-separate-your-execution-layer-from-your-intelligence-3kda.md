<p>To all my software engineers, computer enthusiasts, or just vibe coders — this one's for you.</p>

<p>I'm open-sourcing my personal toolkit for <strong>Claude Code</strong>. It lets you cleanly separate your <strong>execution layer</strong> from your <strong>intelligence layer</strong> — giving you more control, better structure, and a smarter way to build with AI.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why I Built This
</h2>

<p>When working with Claude Code, I found myself wanting a cleaner architecture — one where the AI's reasoning and the actual execution of tasks are decoupled. This separation gives you:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>More control</strong> over how tasks are executed</li>
<li>
<strong>Better structure</strong> for complex workflows</li>
<li>
<strong>Easier debugging</strong> when things go sideways</li>
<li>
<strong>Cleaner code</strong> that's easier to maintain and extend</li>
</ul>

<h2>

</h2>

<p>The repo is live and ready to go:</p>

<p>👉 <strong><a href="https://github.com/intellegix/claude-code-toolkit" rel="noopener noreferrer">claude-code-toolkit on GitHub</a></strong></p>

<p>Feel free to fork it, open issues, submit PRs, or just use it as inspiration for your own setup.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Built in Public
</h2>

<p>I'm a big believer in building in public and sharing what works. If this helps even one developer level up their AI workflow, it was worth open-sourcing.</p>

<p>Drop a comment if you have questions, ideas, or feedback. Let's build something great together.</p>
