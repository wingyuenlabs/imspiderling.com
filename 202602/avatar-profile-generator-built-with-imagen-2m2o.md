<h2>
  
  
  What I Built
</h2>

<p>I built an avatar picture generator using this prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Please create an app that takes an image of a face and generates an identical social media avatar using imagen."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The avatar generator transforms a photo into an avatar profile image using Imagen.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  My Experience
</h2>

<p>Working through the Google AI Studio track gave me a much deeper appreciation for how quickly you can turn an idea into a working AI‑powered tool. A few things stood out during the process:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Prompt design is a real skill<br>
I expected prompts to matter, but I didn’t realize how much small phrasing changes could affect the output. Tweaking the avatar‑generation prompt taught me that clarity, constraints, and examples dramatically improve consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>Imagen handles identity far better than I expected<br>
The biggest surprise was how well the model preserved facial structure while still applying a stylized avatar look. It didn’t just “filter” the image — it actually understood the face and recreated it in a new style.</p></li>
<li><p>The app‑building workflow is incredibly smooth<br>
Being able to build, test, and deploy inside AI Studio without juggling multiple tools made the whole process feel lightweight. The preview mode made iteration fast, and the UI felt designed for experimentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Safety and guardrails are built in, not bolted on<br>
Seeing how the platform automatically handles safety checks gave me a better understanding of what responsible AI development looks like. It’s reassuring to know the system is doing some of the heavy lifting.</p></li>
<li><p>Small projects can feel surprisingly complete<br>
Even though this app is simple, connecting image input → model generation → output display made it feel like a real, usable tool. It reinforced how accessible AI‑powered features are becoming for solo developers.</p></li>
</ol>
