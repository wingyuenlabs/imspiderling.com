<p><strong>Power BI</strong> is a Microsoft business analytics platform that transforms raw data from various sources into interactive, actionable insights and stunning visualizations. It serves as a self-service BI tool for data modeling, reporting, and sharing dashboards across organizations, allowing users to make data-driven decisions faster. </p>

<p><strong>1. Cleaning and Modeling Messy Data</strong></p>

<p><strong>Data Integration:</strong> Combining information from multiple sources (databases, spreadsheets, APIs) that may have different formats.</p>

<p><strong>Cleaning and modeling</strong> messy data in Power BI is primarily achieved using Power Query Editor to transform raw data into a structured format before loading it. Essential techniques include removing nulls/duplicates, changing data types, splitting columns, pivoting/unpivoting, and establishing a star schema (fact/dimension tables) for optimized reporting, ensuring data accuracy and performance. </p>

<p><strong>Data Modeling:</strong> Structuring tables with relationships (star schema or snowflake schema) so that analysis is efficient and reliable.<br>
Business Context: Analysts start by clarifying the business question to ensure the model supports decision-making</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)****<br>
<strong>Calculated Columns</strong>: Creating new columns (e.g., age groups, profit margins).</p>

<p><strong>Measures</strong>: Defining dynamic calculations like totals, averages, year-to-date growth.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced Logic</strong>: Applying filters, conditional logic, and time intelligence functions to uncover trends.<br>
Flexibility: DAX allows analysts to go beyond raw numbers and create meaningful KPIs that align with business goals</p>

<p><strong>3. Building Dashboards for Action</strong><br>
<strong>Interactive Visuals:</strong> Charts, maps, and matrices that let users drill down into details.</p>

<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Dashboards are designed to highlight patterns, anomalies, and opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Decision Support:</strong> Leaders can quickly see which areas need attention, whether operational (daily performance), tactical (monthly trends), or strategic (long-term growth).</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding Pitfalls:</strong> A polished dashboard is only useful if the underlying data is clean and modeled correctly; otherwise, it risks misleading decision-makers.</p>
