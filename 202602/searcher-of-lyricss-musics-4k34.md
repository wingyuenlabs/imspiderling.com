<p>This application was developed to search for song lyrics based on the band/artist name and the song title.</p>

<p>The graphical interface was built using Streamlit, while HTTP requests to the external API are handled with the requests library.</p>

<p>Technologies used</p>

<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Streamlit</li>
<li>Requests</li>
<li>API Lyrics.ovh</li>
</ul>

<p>How it works? And How to Run the Projec?<br>
See the readme file in my repository on GitHub.<br>

<p>3 - Click on Search and wait for the response. If the lyrics are found, they will appear below.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvz6pvv2mszpk408akzef.PNG" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fvz6pvv2mszpk408akzef.PNG" alt=" " width="800" height="356"></a></p>

<p>4 - If the lyrics is not found, a message will appear informing you:</p>

<p>What I learned with this project:<br>
I learned a lot while building this project. I got a much better understanding of how APIs and HTTP requests actually work, seeing how the communication happens between my app and an external service. I also figured out how to handle different status codes and implement user-friendly error messages when a letter is not found.<br>
Another cool thing was learning about URL encoding and why it’s important when you’re working with names that have spaces, accents, or special characters. On top of that, I explored Streamlit and realized how fast and simple it is to create a clean interface without needing heavy frameworks. <br>
Overall, this project helped me improve my coding style, keep things organized, and connect different tools together in a way that actually works for the user</p>
