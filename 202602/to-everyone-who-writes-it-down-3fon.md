<p>My first dev.to post is an ode to the writers I've read over the years.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  I have big shoes to fill
</h2>

<p>As a writer myself, not necessarily a subject matter expert, I deeply admire the expertise I see here.</p>

<p>What amazes me most isn't just the depth of knowledge. It's the willingness to write it down.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  So many of you aren't "technical writers"
</h2>

<p>You're engineers shipping features. Product managers juggling roadmaps. Team leads navigating people and pressure.</p>

<p>And yet, you write.</p>

<p>You don't have to write. No one is assigning you essays.</p>

<p>And yet, you document, explain, and reflect.</p>

<p>As someone who loves writing for its own sake, I see the skill in what you do - even when you don't call yourselves writers. You are.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  There's something deeply generous about tech writing
</h2>

<p>Technical writing is an act of care.</p>

<p>It says, "I struggled through this, let me make it easier for you."</p>

<p>It says, "Here's what I learned, so you don't have to learn it the hard way."</p>

<p>It says, "You're not alone in this."</p>

<p>I've benefited from that care for years. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  My attempt to return the favor
</h2>

<p>I'm not a subject matter expert. At best, I'm a technologist 0th. What I am, first and foremost, is a writer. And as a writer, I notice what you do - even when it's not your job to write.</p>

<p>Thank you - to everyone who writes, documents, and reflects. You've made the path clearer, the work more understandable, and the community richer. I hope I can do the same. </p>
