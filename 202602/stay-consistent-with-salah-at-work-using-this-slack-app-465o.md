<p>It is 4:47 PM.</p>

<p>You are fasting.<br>
Energy is low.<br>
There is one more meeting before the day ends.<br>
Slack notifications keep coming in.</p>

<p>Then you check the time.</p>

<p>Asr started 20 minutes ago.</p>

<p>You meant to pray on time.<br>
But work did not slow down.</p>

<p>For many Muslim professionals, Ramadan does not pause deadlines. It makes the balance between work and worship more challenging.</p>

<p>That is exactly why I built Muslim Prayer Reminder for Slack.<br>
A Slack app designed to help you stay consistent with salah without leaving your workspace.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why a Prayer Reminder Inside Slack?
</h2>

<p>If you spend most of your day in Slack, it becomes your main environment.</p>

<p>Opening another app to check prayer times:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interrupts your workflow</li>
<li>Gets forgotten</li>
<li>Feels disconnected from your workday</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, prayer reminders appear directly inside Slack.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmtn8s9mqdct9usgornf4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fmtn8s9mqdct9usgornf4.png" alt=" " width="744" height="341"></a></p>

<p>No loud alarms.<br>
No intrusive popups.<br>
Just a respectful notification at the right time.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Pre-Adhan Reminders: Prepare Before Prayer Time
</h2>

<p>One of the newest features, especially helpful during Ramadan, is Pre-Adhan Reminders.</p>

<p>You can choose to receive a reminder:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 minutes before prayer</li>
<li>10 minutes before</li>
<li>15 minutes before</li>
<li>20 minutes or more</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frgcljq2koq1dttai0ooj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Frgcljq2koq1dttai0ooj.png" alt=" " width="693" height="242"></a></p>

<p>That small buffer gives you time to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finish a task</li>
<li>Wrap up a meeting</li>
<li>Make wudu calmly</li>
<li>Mentally shift from work mode to worship</li>
</ul>

<p>During Ramadan, that transition matters. It removes rush and brings intention back into the moment.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🤝 Join Jama’ah: Find Colleagues to Pray Together
</h2>

<p>Many Muslim employees do not always know who else wants to pray.</p>

<p>With the Join Jama’ah button:</p>

<ul>
<li>When prayer time arrives, you click once</li>
<li>A simple message is posted</li>
<li>Others can respond and join</li>
</ul>

<p>No awkward conversations.<br>
No guessing.<br>
Just a clear signal that you are heading to pray.</p>

<p>The Prophet ﷺ said that prayer in congregation carries greater reward. Even in modern offices or remote teams, that opportunity should not be lost.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🕌 Set Status: Praying
</h2>

<p>Another powerful feature for Ramadan is Set Status: Praying.</p>

<p>With one click:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your Slack status becomes 🕌 Praying</li>
<li>You select a duration from 10 to 60 minutes</li>
<li>It automatically resets when time ends</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2h57r9o10s8ft9mr47qa.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2h57r9o10s8ft9mr47qa.gif" alt="🕌 Set Status: Praying" width="720" height="372"></a></p>

<p>This creates clarity.</p>

<p>Your team understands you are temporarily unavailable.<br>
There is no need to explain or apologize.<br>
Prayer becomes part of your routine, not an interruption.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Accurate, Location-Based Prayer Times
</h2>

<p>Muslim Prayer Reminder for Slack calculates prayer times based on your country and preferred calculation method.</p>

<p>You configure it once using the /prayer command.</p>

<p>You can choose:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which prayers to receive</li>
<li>Channel or direct message notifications</li>
<li>Arabic or English language</li>
<li>Your preferred calculation method</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you are in Cairo, Dubai, London, Toronto, or working remotely across time zones, prayer times adjust automatically. This is especially important during Ramadan when Maghrib timing determines Iftar.</p>







<h2>

<p>Meetings will continue.<br>
Emails will continue.<br>
Slack will continue.</p>

<p>Ramadan will leave.</p>

<p><strong>If a simple reminder inside your workspace helps you pray on time, break your fast on time, and pray in congregation when possible, then technology is serving your deen.</strong></p>

<p>Ramadan Kareem 🌙<br>
May Allah accept our fasting, our prayers, and our efforts.</p>
