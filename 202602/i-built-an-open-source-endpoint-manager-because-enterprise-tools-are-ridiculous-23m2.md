<p>Let me start with a confession: I have too many computers.</p>

<p>Three Windows Servers, a handful of workstations, a Linux box running... stuff. You know how it goes. One day you're setting up a home lab, next thing you know you're managing a small fleet and wondering which machine has that outdated Log4j version.</p>

<p>Commercial endpoint management tools exist, sure. But have you seen the pricing? We're talking $10-15 per endpoint per month for the basics. PDQ Deploy wants $500/year minimum. Microsoft Intune is... well, it's Microsoft. And don't get me started on trying to self-host SCCM.</p>

<p>So I did what any reasonable developer does when faced with expensive software: I built my own.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/BenediktSchackenberg/octofleet" rel="noopener noreferrer">Octofleet</a> is an open-source endpoint management platform. It's what I wished existed when I started looking for solutions: simple to deploy, actually useful, and doesn't require a finance department to approve.</p>

<p><strong>Fair warning:</strong> This is still beta software. I'm running it in production on my own infrastructure (because I like living dangerously), but you should probably test it properly before deploying to anything critical. That said — it works, and it's been stable for weeks now.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What It Actually Does
</h2>

<p>The feature list grew organically from "things I kept needing":</p>

<p><strong>Hardware &amp; Software Inventory</strong><br>
Every machine reports what's installed, what hardware it has, disk space, network adapters — the works. I got tired of RDP-ing into servers just to check if something was installed.</p>

<p><strong>Remote Job Execution</strong><br>
Run PowerShell scripts or Bash commands across your fleet. Schedule them, target specific groups, see results in real-time. No more "let me just quickly SSH into 5 machines to check something."</p>

<p><strong>Vulnerability Scanning</strong><br>
This one surprised me how useful it became. The platform pulls CVE data from NVD and cross-references it with installed software. Suddenly I knew exactly which machines had vulnerable versions of stuff I'd forgotten I installed.</p>

<p><strong>Auto-Remediation</strong><br>
Found a vulnerability? Octofleet can automatically update the affected software via winget or Chocolatey. It's like having a very focused, very patient sysadmin working 24/7.</p>

<p><strong>Performance Monitoring</strong><br>
Real-time CPU, RAM, and disk metrics with a "hotspot matrix" that shows you at a glance which machines need attention. No more guessing which server is struggling.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Architecture (For Those Who Care)
</h2>

<p>I went with a stack I actually enjoy working with:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Frontend (Next.js)             │
│            React + Tailwind CSS             │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │ REST API
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│              Backend (FastAPI)              │
│               Python 3.12                   │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
    │ Windows │  │ Windows │  │  Linux  │
    │  Agent  │  │  Agent  │  │  Agent  │
    │ (.NET 8)│  │ (.NET 8)│  │ (Bash)  │

         └────────────┴────────────┘
               HTTPS polling
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Why TimescaleDB? Because storing weeks of performance metrics in regular PostgreSQL tables gets ugly fast. TimescaleDB handles time-series data compression and retention automatically.</p>

<p>The Windows agent is a single .NET 8 executable (~8MB) that runs as a service. No installer dependencies, no runtime requirements on the target machine. The Linux agent is a bash script because... sometimes simple wins.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Getting Started
</h2>

<p>If you want to try it:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>git clone https://github.com/BenediktSchackenberg/octofleet.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>octofleet
docker compose up <span class="nt">-d</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>That's it. Open <code>http://localhost:3000</code>, login with <code>admin/admin</code>, and you've got a running instance.</p>

<p>For agents, there's a one-liner for Windows:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight powershell"><code><span class="n">iwr</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenediktSchackenberg/octofleet/main/Install-OctofleetAgent.ps1"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">-OutFile</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$</span><span class="nn">env</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">TEMP</span><span class="s2">\install.ps1"</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$</span><span class="nn">env</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">TEMP</span><span class="s2">\install.ps1"</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>The agent auto-registers with your server and starts reporting immediately.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How It Compares
</h2>

<p>I'm not going to pretend Octofleet replaces enterprise solutions. But for homelabs, small businesses, or anyone who just wants basic fleet management without the complexity:</p>

<div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Octofleet</th>
<th>PDQ Deploy</th>
<th>NinjaRMM</th>
<th>SCCM</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Price</td>
<td>Free</td>
<td>$500+/yr</td>
<td>$3+/endpoint/mo</td>
<td>LOL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Self-hosted</td>

</table></div>

<p>The big players have more features, better polish, enterprise support. But they also have enterprise complexity and enterprise pricing. Pick your poison.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Honest "Beta Software" Section
</h2>

<p>Things that work well:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inventory collection is solid</li>
<li>Job execution is reliable</li>
<li>The dashboard is genuinely useful day-to-day</li>
<li>Auto-updates for agents work (finally, after some painful debugging)</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I'm still working on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Documentation could be better (it exists, but it's... sparse)</li>
<li>macOS agent doesn't exist yet</li>
<li>Reporting/exports are basic</li>
<li>No mobile app (and probably never will be)</li>
</ul>

<p>Known quirks:</p>

<ul>
<li>First-time setup needs you to configure the gateway URL manually</li>
<li>Some edge cases in vulnerability matching (CVE data is messy)</li>
<li>The UI has some rough edges on mobile</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Why I'm Sharing This
</h2>

<p>Honestly? I want feedback.</p>

<p>This started as a personal project to scratch my own itch. But it's grown into something that might be useful for others, and I'd love to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>What features are missing that would make this useful for you?</li>
<li>What's confusing about the setup?</li>
<li>What breaks when you try it?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm also very open to contributions. The codebase is reasonably clean (I think), the stack is modern, and there's plenty of low-hanging fruit for anyone wanting to contribute to an open-source project.</p>

<p>If you try it, let me know how it goes. Open an issue, leave a comment here, or just star the repo if you think it's cool.</p>

<p>And if you're running a fleet of machines and paying too much for basic management tools — maybe give this a shot. Worst case, you'll have wasted 5 minutes on <code>docker compose up</code>. Best case, you'll save a bunch of money and have something you can actually customize.</p>
