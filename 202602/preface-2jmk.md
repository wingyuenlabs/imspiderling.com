<h1>
  
  
  Motivation of making the blog?
</h1>

<p>I wanted to record my studies to have consistency. Since I don't directly learn building projects from my CS program. And I want to be an expert in my area. </p>

<h1>
  
  
  Tags
</h1>

<p>I'll use this tags to separate my study areas. So let's be on the same page!!!</p>

<ul>
<li>Frontend -&gt; Project Fr</li>
<li>Backend -&gt; Project Bk </li>
<li>OpenCV -&gt; Project Cv</li>
<li>Cybersecurity Reversing -&gt; Project Rv</li>
</ul>

<p>*Interactive arts name tag has not been decided yet.<br>
*Personal project will be tagged with each name.<br>
*I haven't decided other cybersecurity area tags. </p>
