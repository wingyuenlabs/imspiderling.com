<p>I’ve been writing software long enough to know one eternal truth:</p>

<p>Nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The “Quick Fix” That Became Core Infrastructure
</h2>

<p>You know this story.</p>

<p>You add:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// TODO: replace with proper solution later
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>That was 2019.</p>

<p>It’s now handling 38% of company revenue.</p>

<p>Nobody knows how it works.<br>
Nobody wants to touch it.<br>
It has achieved sentience.</p>
<h2>
  
  
  The Rewrite Cycle (Senior Edition)
</h2>

<p>Every few years, a brave soul says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We should rewrite this properly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The room nods.</p>

<p>The juniors look inspired.<br>
The mid-levels look ambitious.<br>
The seniors look tired.</p>

<p>Because seniors know the stages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Excitement</li>
<li>Overconfidence</li>
<li>Underestimation</li>
<li>Scope explosion</li>
<li>“Let’s just integrate with the old system for now”</li>
<li>Now you have two systems</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations.<br>
You’ve doubled your bugs.</p>
<h2>
  
  
  The Microservices Enlightenment
</h2>

<p>At some point someone discovered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Kubernetes</li>
<li>Apache Kafka</li>
</ul>

<p>And thought:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Yes. This is what our 4-person startup needs.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For 2,000 users.</p>

<p>With one database.</p>

<p>Running on a single VM.</p>

<p>But now we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>14 services</li>
<li>6 CI pipelines</li>
<li>1 engineer who understands networking</li>
<li>0 engineers who sleep peacefully</li>
</ul>
<h2>
  
  
  The Senior Developer Starter Pack
</h2>

<p>You know you’ve been around too long when:</p>

<ul>
<li>You measure architecture decisions in “future therapy sessions.”</li>
<li>You get nervous when someone says “Let’s innovate.”</li>
<li>You trust the boring stack.</li>
<li>You ask, “What happens when this fails?” before asking, “How fast is it?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Juniors optimize for speed.<br>
Mid-levels optimize for elegance.<br>
Seniors optimize for survivability.</p>
<h2>
  
  
  The 3AM Production Incident
</h2>

<p>Nothing bonds engineers like:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>CPU: 100%
Memory: gone
Logs: silent
Slack: exploding
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Someone suggests scaling horizontally.</p>

<p>Someone suggests clearing cache.</p>

<p>Someone suggests rewriting in Go.</p>

<p>The senior quietly says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Did anyone check the cron job?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was the cron job.</p>

<p>It’s always the cron job.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The AI Era
</h2>

<p>Now we have AI generating code.</p>

<p>Which is fantastic.</p>

<p>Because now instead of debugging:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your mistakes</li>
</ul>

<p>You debug:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your mistakes</li>
<li>The model’s mistakes</li>
<li>And the interaction between both</li>
</ul>

<p>Progress.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  “We’ll Clean It Up Later”
</h2>

<p>This sentence has built more legacy systems than COBOL.</p>

<p>Every system starts clean.</p>

<p>Then comes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A hotfix</li>
<li>A deadline</li>
<li>A “temporary” flag</li>
<li>A feature request from sales</li>
</ul>

<p>And suddenly your elegant architecture looks like it lost a bar fight.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Hidden Senior Skill
</h2>

<p>After 15+ years, your real superpower isn’t coding.</p>

<p>It’s saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“No.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, we don’t need microservices.<br>
No, we don’t need a rewrite.<br>
No, we don’t need 6 new dependencies.<br>
No, we don’t need real-time event streaming for user profile edits.</p>

<p>The ability to prevent complexity is worth more than the ability to build it.</p>

<p>But nobody puts that on LinkedIn.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Real Promotion
</h2>

<p>The moment you become senior isn’t when you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Master a framework</li>
<li>Learn a new language</li>
<li>Ship a big feature</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s when you realize:</p>

<p>Shipping less code is often the most responsible thing you can do.</p>

<p>And if you’ve ever:</p>

<ul>
<li>Commented out code instead of deleting it</li>
<li>Whispered “please work” before hitting deploy</li>
<li>Added logging and called it observability</li>
<li>Or said “it’s a small change” in a meeting</li>
</ul>

<p>You’re one of us.</p>

<p>Welcome.</p>
