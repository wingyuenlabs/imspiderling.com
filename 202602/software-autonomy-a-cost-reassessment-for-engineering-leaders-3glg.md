<p>SaaS became the default not because it produced optimal systems, but because custom software was costly to build and costly to maintain. For most teams, adapting processes to generalized tools was cheaper than owning software.</p>

<p>That assumption no longer holds.</p>

<p>AI materially changes the economics of internal software along two dimensions: build cost and maintenance cost. Both are now low enough that the traditional SaaS trade-off needs reassessment.</p>

<ol>
<li>Build Cost Is No Longer the Primary Barrier</li>
</ol>

<p>Historically, even modest internal tools required:<br>
    • Multiple engineers<br>
    • Months of development<br>
    • Cross-functional coordination<br>
    • High opportunity cost</p>

<p>Typical figures:<br>
    • 300–600 engineering hours<br>
    • 2–4 months to first usable version<br>
    • Dedicated ownership from senior engineers</p>

<p>With AI-assisted development:<br>
    • Boilerplate and scaffolding are largely automated<br>
    • CRUD, APIs, schemas, and UI layers are generated quickly<br>
    • Iteration cycles compress significantly</p>

<p>Observed outcomes across teams:<br>
    • 40–70% reduction in build time<br>
    • Functional internal tools delivered in 2–3 weeks<br>
    • One engineer often sufficient for end-to-end delivery</p>

<p>The threshold at which “build vs buy” favors building is materially lower than it was even two years ago.</p>

<ol>
<li>Maintenance Is No Longer an All-or-Nothing Commitment</li>
</ol>

<p>Maintenance was the stronger argument for SaaS.</p>

<p>Internal tools historically required:<br>
    • Continuous dependency management<br>
    • Security updates<br>
    • Refactoring as platforms evolved<br>
    • Long-term ownership guarantees</p>

<p>SaaS centralized this burden and reduced organizational risk.</p>

<p>That advantage is eroding.</p>

<p>Open Source as Risk Reduction</p>

<p>For limited-scope tools, open sourcing internal software:<br>
    • Reduces lock-in to specific teams<br>
    • Makes audits and rewrites easier<br>
    • Lowers replacement cost if ownership changes</p>

<p>Maintenance still exists, but failure becomes less expensive.</p>

<p>Agent-Assisted Maintenance</p>

<p>AI systems are already handling parts of routine upkeep:<br>
    • Dependency updates<br>
    • Refactoring outdated code paths<br>
    • Running and fixing tests<br>
    • Identifying unused or low-value logic</p>

<p>Early results show:<br>
    • 30–50% reduction in manual maintenance effort<br>
    • Faster recovery from breakages<br>
    • Lower reluctance to modify existing systems</p>

<p>Maintenance shifts from continuous effort to periodic review.</p>

<p>Implication for Engineering Leadership</p>

<p>SaaS solved two problems: high build cost and high maintenance cost. AI reduces both.</p>

<p>When internal software can be built quickly, modified cheaply, and maintained with limited ongoing effort, generalized tools lose their structural advantage. For many teams, owning small, focused systems is now the lower-risk option.</p>

<p>This is not a tooling preference change.<br>
It is a change in cost curves.</p>

<p>Engineering leaders should revisit build-vs-buy decisions with updated assumptions, especially for:<br>
    • Workflow-heavy tools<br>
    • Domain-specific systems<br>
    • Teams with stable, well-understood processes</p>

<p>The default answer no longer needs to be SaaS.</p>
