<p>After reviewing hundreds of resumes for software engineering, data science, and PM roles, I noticed the same patterns killing great candidates' chances. Here's what I found.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  1. No Metrics = No Impact
</h2>

<p><strong>Bad:</strong> "Improved system performance"<br>
<strong>Good:</strong> "Reduced API latency by 40%, saving $50K/month in infrastructure costs"</p>

<p>Hiring managers scan for numbers. If your bullet points don't have them, you look like everyone else.</p>

<p><strong>Formula:</strong> [Action verb] + [what you did] + [quantified result]</p>

<h2>
  
  
  2. Not ATS-Optimized
</h2>

<p>75% of resumes are rejected by Applicant Tracking Systems before a human ever sees them.</p>

<p><strong>Quick fixes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use standard section headers: Experience, Education, Skills</li>
<li>No tables, columns, or graphics</li>
<li>Mirror keywords from the job description</li>
<li>Submit as PDF (unless they ask for .docx)</li>
<li>Put contact info in the body, not header/footer</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  3. The "Responsible For" Epidemic
</h2>

<p>"Responsible for" is the weakest way to start a bullet point.</p>

<p><strong>Instead, use power verbs:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Architected, Built, Designed (for creation)</li>
<li>Reduced, Optimized, Eliminated (for improvement)
</li>
<li>Led, Mentored, Coordinated (for leadership)</li>
<li>Launched, Shipped, Deployed (for delivery)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  4. Burying the Impact
</h2>

<p>Your strongest achievement should be in the top 3 lines — not buried on page 2.</p>

<p>Recruiters spend <strong>6 seconds</strong> on the first scan. If they don't see something impressive immediately, they move on.</p>

<p><strong>Structure each bullet:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Result first] by [what you did] using [technology/method]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes by implementing CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and Docker</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  
  
  5. Too Long
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Less than 10 years experience → <strong>1 page</strong>
</li>
<li>10+ years → 2 pages max</li>
<li>Nobody wants to read 3 pages</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut anything older than 5 years unless it's directly relevant.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The ATS Checklist
</h2>

<p>Here's a quick checklist you can use before every application:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ ] Standard section headers</li>
<li>[ ] No tables or graphics</li>
<li>[ ] Keywords from JD included</li>
<li>[ ] Contact info at top (not in header/footer)</li>
<li>[ ] PDF format</li>
<li>[ ] File name: FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf</li>
<li>[ ] Each bullet starts with action verb</li>
<li>[ ] At least 50% of bullets have metrics</li>
<li>[ ] 1 page (if &lt; 10 years exp)</li>
</ul>
