<p>TL;DR - I didn't expect Python to be as much of a pain and joy as it was.</p>

<p>I have been learning Python for the past three months or so now, and I have had a love-hate relationship with the language. When I started out, I was pretty excited about learning Python. You hear that it's the language of the future, and the general vibe given is, <em>"If you don't know Python, why are you even here?"</em></p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4b6dmztfxwif5ji2n2c8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F4b6dmztfxwif5ji2n2c8.png" alt=" " width="800" height="461"></a></p>

<p>So you bet I was excited and very eager to learn to get ahead of the curve while I had this chance. The beginning of the learning was pretty okay. There was the learning of functions and figuring out where it intersected with JavaScript. The transition at the beginning was rough but manageable.</p>

<p>Then came OOP. Now, OOP and I have history, and not a good one. I have always struggled with this topic in Java, so seeing it in Python made my blood run cold. I struggled going through the OOP concepts so badly that I almost gave up on learning them altogether. On some days, I'd just straight up ignore the topic, and on other days, I'd sit on the computer for hours just to get a concept through my head. I will say this though: for any beginners out there, if something isn't sticking, skim over it. When you get into thicker topics, trust me, the harder ones will look a little more enticing once you've gone through muddier waters.</p>

<p>Anyways, here we are, at the end of the road, or rather, the beginning of one. I sincerely can't wait to see what more I can do with Python. It has been fascinating seeing what I can do using the language, and I know for sure there's lots and lots more to come. </p>

<p>So here's to seeing where this new beginning leads.</p>
