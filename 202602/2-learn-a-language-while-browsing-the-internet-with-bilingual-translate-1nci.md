<p>15 beautiful themes, 50+ languages, and instant translations - all in one extension.</p>

<p>Announcement<br>
With the Chrome extension I released today, you can read any site in two languages ​​"just like in the image" and see the meanings of individual words. With over 50 languages ​​and more than 15 theme options, you can read and learn English at no extra cost using Google's built-in translation feature. The link is right below 👇<br>

<p>Context<br>
Yesterday I started a Vibe Coding Challenge, I plan to release a new product every day, and today is my second day. You can check out the article to learn about the process (labdays.io)</p>

<p><strong>Notes from the second day of the Challenge</strong><br>
To avoid the analysis paralysis I experienced before Vibe coding, I started 3 different projects at once.<br>
These projects were difficult, medium, and easy level.<br>
I thought, if I couldn't finish the others, I would at least be able to ship the easy one.<br>
Working on three projects simultaneously is enjoyable and provides momentum.<br>
When I first started the projects, I thought I couldn't do it and I was a little scared.<br>
Was I overestimating my abilities? But there was no talent here, this was Claude's talent, and I regained my courage.<br>
The sheer volume of work produced in just about two hours was enormous.<br>
But I had to choose one to polish, and I chose the Bilingual Translate app.<br>
It took quite a while to get it ready for publication, and it's finally finished.<br>
I created a landing page and a gumroad page.<br>
And everything is ready. It was a long day.<br>
I think the other notes I made to myself below will be useful for you as well.<br>
See you tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Insights</strong><br>
The bigger the goals, the bigger the results.<br>
I realize that the imagination is unlocking more and more as I see what's possible.<br>
Sometimes I make requests as absurd as a child's wishes, and the AI just handles them.<br>
Design is always the most time-consuming thing for me.<br>
Elon Musk always emphasizes the importance of a tight feedback loop, and he is absolutely right. I show my progress to the AI, get its criticism, and improve it further in each cycle.<br>
The first 99% of the project takes 99% of the time, but the remaining 1% takes another 99%. It's just as difficult.<br>
AI can easily handle broad strokes, but when it comes to subtle details, it lacks finesse (or it feels like using a sledgehammer for a delicate task).<br>
The interface shapes your entire thought process. When I developed the same project with different interfaces, it went in different directions.<br>
I work more efficiently in the mornings, and my battery runs out towards evening. I need to take two-hour naps like Leonardo Da Vinci.<br>
Development is full of grunt work, and it takes way too long</p>

<p><strong>Things I need to automate</strong><br>
I need to be able to make social media posts with a single click.<br>
I need to edit the .claude folder so that Claude code doesn't ask for permissions.<br>
I need to gather all the AI ​​APIs I use into a single file (I'm currently wasting time finding them from old projects).<br>
I need to turn the commit and push loop into a script and do it with a single command.<br>
Since the AI ​​is unaware of current AI models, I constantly have to go to websites and change the models. I need to create a helper with costs that will allow me to automatically retrieve model pages.<br>
I need to turn the usage limits and reset time information shown on Claude's site into a widget on my screen.</p>

<p><strong>To-do list</strong><br>
I need to gather the necessary tools for rapid development in Vibe Coding and share them with other developers.<br>
I need to connect multiple monitors because I'm now working on three projects at once.</p>

<p><strong>Mistakes</strong><br>
I should have chosen the project I needed to focus on earlier. I spent more than half the day working on three different projects.</p>
