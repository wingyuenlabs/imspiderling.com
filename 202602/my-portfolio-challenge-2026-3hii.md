<blockquote>
<p>Technical Note: I fully containerized this application using a Dockerfile for Google Cloud Run. However, due to billing verification issues that persisted on the final deadline day, I have hosted the live version on GitHub Pages while providing the full Docker configuration in my repository to demonstrate the technical implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  
  
  How I Built It
</h2>

<p>This portfolio was created using pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Java script   to ensure high performance and simplicity, To prepare for the Google Cloud Run requirement, I created a custom Dockerfile based on <em>nginx:alpine</em> to serve my static files on <em>port 8080.</em></p>

<p>Google AI &amp; Tools used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gemini AI: Assisted in architecting the Docker container and troubleshooting Google Cloud SDK commands.</li>
<li>Google Cloud Shell: Used as the primary development environment to manage files and attempt deployment.</li>
<li>Antigravity: This is core implementation assistance that written the code and turning the idea to real project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  What I'm Most Proud Of
</h2>

<p>I am most proud of the animation physics that was applied during implementation stage and also getting new experience with package Docker container during running the cloud run. As a developer and problem solver we are always welcoming new challenges, solve them, get experience and move.<br>
Thanks All.</p>
