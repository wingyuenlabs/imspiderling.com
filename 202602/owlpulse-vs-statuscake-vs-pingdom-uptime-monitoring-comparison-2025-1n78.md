<p>The uptime monitoring market got a wake-up call in July 2025. Here's how the top options actually compare.</p>




<p>If you've been using UptimeRobot, you already know what happened: prices jumped from ~$8/month to $34/month overnight. A 425% increase.</p>

<p>Suddenly, everyone's shopping for alternatives. But which one?</p>

<p>I compared three popular options — <strong>StatusCake</strong>, <strong>Pingdom</strong>, and <strong>OwlPulse</strong> — on the metrics that actually matter: price, features, and what you get on the free tier.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  StatusCake
</h2>

<p><strong>The veteran.</strong> StatusCake has been around since 2012 and has a solid reputation.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Generous free tier (10 monitors)</li>
<li>Page speed monitoring included</li>
<li>Decent integrations</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Paid plans start at $20.41/month — more than double OwlPulse</li>
<li>UI feels dated</li>
<li>Some features locked behind higher tiers</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams already using it who don't want to migrate.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Pingdom
</h2>

<p><strong>The enterprise choice.</strong> Owned by SolarWinds, Pingdom is the "safe" choice for larger companies.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rock-solid infrastructure</li>
<li>Real User Monitoring (RUM) available</li>
<li>Great uptime history</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No free tier at all</li>
<li>$15/month gets you only 10 monitors</li>
<li>SMS and advanced alerting costs extra</li>
<li>Feels like paying enterprise prices for indie needs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Companies with compliance requirements or existing SolarWinds relationships.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  OwlPulse
</h2>

<p><strong>The new challenger.</strong> Built specifically for developers priced out by UptimeRobot's 2025 increase.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>$9/month for unlimited monitors</li>
<li>Free tier with 5 monitors, no credit card required</li>
<li>SMS alerts included (not an add-on)</li>
<li>Clean, modern UI</li>
<li>1-minute checks on paid plans</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Newer product (less track record)</li>
<li>Smaller team</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Indie hackers, small SaaS teams, and anyone who thinks $34/month for uptime monitoring is absurd.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  The Verdict
</h2>

<p>Here's my honest take:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>If you're an enterprise</strong> with budget to spare and need RUM → Pingdom</li>
<li>
<strong>If you want a free tier and don't mind paying $20+</strong> → StatusCake
</li>
<li>
<strong>If you want the best value and a tool built for developers</strong> → OwlPulse</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm biased (I helped build OwlPulse), but the numbers speak for themselves. At $9/month with SMS included, it's less than half what StatusCake charges and less than UptimeRobot's new pricing.</p>
