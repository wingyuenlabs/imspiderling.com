<p>Today is February 20, 2026. Exactly 35 years ago, Guido van Rossum released the first public version of Python, a language he'd been hacking on during the Christmas holidays as a side project. Let that sink in for a second. A side project from 1991 is now arguably the most popular programming language on the planet.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about this milestone all week, and honestly, the more I dig into Python's story, the more impressed I get. Not because Python is perfect, it's definitely not, but because it kept finding ways to matter, decade after decade, even when the tech world shifted underneath it. That's rare. Languages come and go all the time. Most of them peak and fade within ten years. Python just... kept going.</p>

<p>So let's talk about how a hobby project turned into the backbone of modern AI, web development, data science and pretty much everything in between.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  A Quick Trip Through Four Eras
</h2>

<p>Python's 35-year history breaks down pretty neatly into four phases. Each one could've been the end of the road, but instead each one became a springboard.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Phase 1: The Scripting Era (1991-2000)
</h3>

<p>Back in the early '90s, Python was "a better scripting language." That was the pitch. If you were writing shell scripts or wrestling with C for quick automation tasks, Python gave you something cleaner and more readable. It showed up in universities and Unix shops, quietly building a reputation as the language that didn't make you hate your life when you read someone else's code six months later.</p>

<p>Was it glamorous? Not even close. But it was useful, and people kept coming back to it.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Phase 2: The Web Era (2000-2010)
</h3>

<p>Then the web happened, and suddenly everybody needed a way to build websites that wasn't PHP spaghetti code. Ruby had Rails and that was the cool kid on the block for a while, but Python answered with Django in 2005 and Flask in 2010.</p>

<p>Django gave you the full kitchen, ORM, admin panel, authentication, the works. Flask gave you a knife and a cutting board and said "go build whatever you want." Between the two of them, Python carved out real territory in web development. It wasn't the dominant web language, but it was a serious contender, and startups loved it for getting things shipped fast.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Phase 3: The Data Science Revolution (2010-2020)
</h3>

<p>This is where things went nuclear. NumPy and SciPy had been around for a while, but when Pandas matured and Jupyter Notebooks made exploratory analysis actually pleasant, Python became the default language for anyone touching data. Then TensorFlow and PyTorch showed up, and suddenly Python wasn't just a data language, it was <em>the</em> AI language.</p>

<p>Researchers, data scientists and machine learning engineers all converged on Python. The network effects were enormous. If you wanted to do ML, you used Python. Period. The ecosystem was too deep, the community too large, the tooling too mature to ignore.</p>

<p>Python's identity shifted from "solid web language" to "the language of data and AI." And that identity has only gotten stronger since.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Phase 4: The Platform Era (2020-Present)
</h3>

<p>Now we're in the era where Python is everywhere, and I mean <em>everywhere</em>. FastAPI brought modern, async-first API development with automatic OpenAPI docs. Python runs DevOps pipelines, orchestrates cloud infrastructure, powers AI agents and serves as the glue language connecting systems across the entire stack.</p>

<p>It's not just a language anymore, it's a universal integration platform. You can prototype an idea in the morning, deploy an API by lunch, hook it up to an AI model in the afternoon and automate the whole thing before dinner. That's the power of what Python has become.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  So What Actually Kept Python Alive for 35 Years?
</h2>

<p>Plenty of languages had momentum at some point. Perl was huge. Ruby was everywhere for a while. CoffeeScript had its moment. They all faded or shrank. Python didn't. Why?</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Human-Centered Design
</h3>

<p>This is the big one, and it goes back to Guido's original philosophy. Python optimized for the person reading the code, not the person writing it. That sounds like a small thing, but it's massive over time. Code is read far more often than it's written, and Python's insistence on readability meant that projects stayed maintainable longer, onboarding new developers was easier and collaboration just worked better.</p>

<p>The famous "there should be one obvious way to do it" mantra meant less time arguing about style and more time building things.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Batteries Included
</h3>

<p>Python's standard library was always surprisingly complete. Need to parse JSON? It's there. HTTP requests? There. CSV files, email, regex, unit testing, threading? All there. You could get a lot done before you ever needed to <code>pip install</code> anything.</p>

<p>This mattered enormously in the early days when package management was rough, and it still matters today when you just want to write a quick script without pulling in half the internet.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Ecosystem Flywheel
</h3>

<p>Once Python hit critical mass in universities, the flywheel started spinning. Students learned Python, graduated, used Python at work, wrote libraries in Python, taught Python to the next generation. Researchers published papers with Python code. Startups built MVPs in Python. Every new library made the ecosystem richer, which attracted more developers, which produced more libraries.</p>

<p>It's the classic network effect, and Python benefited from it more than almost any other language in history.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Low Barrier of Entry
</h3>

<p>Python never stopped being approachable. You can teach a complete beginner to write meaningful Python code in a day. That constant influx of new developers kept the community fresh, energetic and growing. Languages that become too complex or too niche eventually stagnate. Python avoided that trap by always keeping the front door wide open.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Adaptability
</h3>

<p>This might be the most underrated factor. Python didn't fight paradigm shifts, it absorbed them. Web frameworks? Python adapted. Data science? Python adapted. Machine learning? Python adapted. Cloud-native microservices? Adapted again. Every time the industry moved, Python found a way to be relevant in the new landscape.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What's Strong Right Now
</h2>

<p>Let's be honest about where Python genuinely excels today, because the list is impressive:</p>

<p><strong>Developer productivity is unmatched.</strong> For getting from idea to working code, nothing beats Python. The read-write-test cycle is incredibly fast, and the language stays out of your way.</p>

<p><strong>AI and ML dominance is real.</strong> PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, LangChain, the entire AI stack runs on Python. If you're doing anything with AI, you're writing Python or you're calling Python.</p>

<p><strong>The ecosystem is massive.</strong> PyPI has hundreds of thousands of packages. Whatever problem you're trying to solve, someone's probably already built a library for it.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-domain reach.</strong> Python is one of the very few languages where the same syntax works for web backends, data analysis, automation scripts, AI models and system administration. That versatility is genuinely rare.</p>

<p><strong>Prototyping speed.</strong> When you need to validate an idea quickly, Python lets you move fast without accumulating too much technical debt in the prototype phase.</p>

<p><strong>Orchestration.</strong> Python has become the default "glue language", the thing that ties together databases, APIs, AI models, cloud services and everything else. FastAPI made this even more compelling with its modern async approach.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What Could Still Get Better
</h2>

<p>I love Python, but I'm not going to pretend it's flawless. There are real pain points that the community has been wrestling with for years.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Performance
</h3>

<p>Let's get the elephant out of the room. Python is slow compared to compiled languages. It uses more memory and CPU time than Go, Rust, Java or C++. Yes, there's Cython, PyPy and the ongoing work on faster CPython. Yes, you can drop into C extensions for hot paths. But the baseline performance story is still a weakness, especially as workloads scale up.</p>

<p>The good news is that the core team is actively working on this. The "Faster CPython" project has already delivered meaningful speedups in recent releases, and JIT compilation is on the roadmap. It won't match Rust anytime soon, but the gap is narrowing.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Packaging Mess
</h3>

<p>Oh, the packaging. We've got pip, poetry, conda, pipenv, pdm, hatch and now uv. Each one has its fans, each one does things slightly differently, and none of them has emerged as the single obvious choice. Compare this to npm in JavaScript or cargo in Rust, where there's basically one answer, and you can see why this frustrates people.</p>

<p>Yes, uv is making a strong case as the future here, it's fast, it's well-designed, and it's backed by the Astral team that gave us Ruff. But we're still in the "multiple competing standards" phase, and it creates real friction for teams and newcomers alike.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The GIL
</h3>

<p>The Global Interpreter Lock has been Python's concurrency bottleneck for decades. It prevents true parallel execution of Python threads on multiple CPU cores. For I/O-bound work it doesn't matter much, but for CPU-intensive parallel processing it's a real limitation.</p>

<p>The exciting development is PEP 703 and the experimental no-GIL builds. Python 3.13 shipped with an experimental free-threaded mode, and the community is cautiously optimistic. This could be a game-changer, but it'll take years for the ecosystem to fully adapt.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Enterprise Governance
</h3>

<p>Dynamic typing is great for speed but can be a headache at scale. Large Python codebases without disciplined use of type hints, linters and testing can become maintenance nightmares. Java and C# have built-in guardrails that Python relies on developers to self-impose.</p>

<p>The gradual typing story with mypy, pyright and type hints has improved enormously, but it's still opt-in. In enterprise environments where dozens of teams touch the same codebase, that "opt-in" nature can be a real challenge.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Java Angle: Rivals or Partners?
</h2>

<p>Java turned 30 last year. Python turns 35 today. And people still love asking "which one should I learn?" as if it's a zero-sum game. It's not.</p>

<p>Here's the thing, Python and Java don't actually compete for the same jobs in most modern architectures. Java is the infrastructure backbone. It runs the banking systems, the telecom platforms, the enterprise middleware that needs to be rock-solid, handle massive concurrency and run for years without surprises. The JVM is a masterpiece of engineering, and Java's static typing and mature tooling make it ideal for large-scale systems where reliability matters more than development speed.</p>

<p>Python is the intelligence layer. It runs the AI models, the data pipelines, the automation scripts and the rapid-prototype APIs. It's where experimentation happens, where new ideas get tested and where developers move fast.</p>

<p>In practice, modern platforms often use both. Java handles the core transactional processing. Python handles the analytics, ML inference and orchestration. They complement each other beautifully, and arguing about which one is "better" misses the point entirely. They're optimized for different things, Java for systems, Python for humans.</p>

<p>If you're early in your career, learn both. Seriously. Having Python and Java in your toolkit makes you valuable in almost any engineering organization.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  My Take on Python's Future
</h2>

<p>I've been writing Python for years, alongside Java and a handful of other languages. Here's what I think the next decade looks like.</p>

<p>Python isn't going anywhere. The AI wave alone guarantees its relevance for at least another ten years. But more than that, Python has demonstrated something powerful: the ability to reinvent itself without losing its soul. It's still readable, still approachable, still the language where you can teach a beginner in the morning and deploy production AI in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The things that need fixing, performance, packaging, the GIL, are all actively being worked on. The community is engaged, the core team is focused and the commercial investment (from companies like Microsoft, Google and Meta) is substantial. Python's governance model, with its steering council and PEP process, has proven resilient and effective.</p>

<p>My prediction? Python at 40 will be faster, better packaged, truly concurrent and even more deeply embedded in AI infrastructure. The language itself will probably look mostly the same, and that's the point. Python's superpower was never about being the most innovative syntax or the fastest runtime. It was about being the most <em>useful</em> language for the most people, and that hasn't changed in 35 years.</p>

<p>Happy birthday, Python. Here's to 35 more.</p>
