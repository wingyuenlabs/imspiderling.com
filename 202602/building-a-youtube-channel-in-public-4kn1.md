<h2>
  
  
  Bootstrapping a YouTube Channel With Code
</h2>

<p>I decided to start a YouTube channel around one simple idea:</p>

<p><strong>What is actually possible with code?</strong></p>

<p>This project is mostly for fun. I want to explore YouTube as a platform and experiment with areas of coding I haven’t touched before. Instead of overthinking it, I’m learning by building in public.</p>

<p>And the first thing I’m building is the tooling for the channel itself.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Building the Tools First
</h2>

<p>The first series is focused entirely on bootstrapping the channel.</p>

<p>Instead of manually recording and editing everything, I’m creating small tools that help me produce better videos. I build the tools, use them to create videos, then improve them as I go.</p>

<p>Over time, I plan to make these tools available to others.</p>

<p>I’m also delegating as much of the coding as possible to AI tools. <br>
Part of this journey is exploring how far AI-assisted development can go, and where it still needs human input.</p>
<h3>
  
  
  The First Attempt
</h3>

<p>I wanted to create a welcome video with a clean terminal-style look.</p>

<p>So I opened <code>iTerm</code> and recorded myself typing the text.</p>

<p>It looked… bad.<br>
Everything was off. The typing felt awkward. It wasn’t what I had imagined.</p>

<p>Here’s that first version:<br>

<br>
Instead of trying to fix the recording setup, I decided to build something better.</p>
<h3>
  
  
  A Simple Terminal Typer App
</h3>

<p>I wrote a small terminal-typer app that simulates typing and exports directly to video.</p>

<p>That way I can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Control timing</li>
<li>Replay scripts consistently</li>
<li>Generate clean output every time</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s how it looks like:<br>

</p>

<p>Using it, I recreated the welcome video, and it turned out much closer to what I originally wanted.</p>

<p>Here is the current version of the welcome video:<br>

</p>

<p><strong>This is just the beginning.</strong></p>

<p>Right now, I’m focused on building the foundation.</p>

<p>If you’d like to follow the journey, consider <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rndthts" rel="noopener noreferrer">subscribing</a></strong><br>
And if there’s something you’d like to see me build, let me know.</p>

<p>If you watched the videos, you’ll notice they’re still silent.<br>
Adding audio is one of the next steps in this experiment.</p>
