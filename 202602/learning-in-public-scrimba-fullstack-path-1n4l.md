<p><strong>Short introduction to myself</strong> </p>

<p>My name is Fredrik, 36 years old, I have a fulltime job working with safety in the energy/oil-gas sector in Norway, educated within the maritime field, I live with my girlfriend, our 1 year old boy and 2 dogs; Kira, which is a 8 year old staffordshire bullterrier, and Macho which is a 6 year old english bulldog/french bulldog/olde english bulldog mix. </p>

<p><strong>Interest in programming</strong><br>
Since I was a teenager, perhaps even before that, I have been interested in programming, I remember when I was able to create my first hyper link, perhaps it was around 26-28 years ago. I think I used 2 days to figure out how to do that, there wasn't many resources to learn from and I was very young so couldn't understand much of the documentation out there....</p>

<p>I took a maritime education and have been working within this field since 2012 - for various shipping companies and operators. </p>

<p>Here we were training with the swedish coastguard on our way to Nynashamn for offloading crude oil.</p>

<p><strong>How to do this?</strong><br>
I am going to start with Scrimba fullstack path, I need to dedicate a fixed amount of time during the week, and post regularly. I am also thinking about registering the actual amount of hours I am using on Scrimba and give a review on my sessions. This is at least what I have in my mind right now, lets see how it develops.. </p>

<p><strong>Motivation and ambition</strong><br>
Motivation is just learning itself. I am not in need or rush to get a developer job or anything like that, but I do have an ambition of being able to create various fullstack projects, and my dream would be to be able to become a freelancer, either as a side gig or as a fulltime freelancer but I am realistic about this. This project with learning in public is mainly to push myself, it creates a pressure on me by publicy announcing that I want to complete the Scrimba fullstack path. </p>

<p>I also hope that I can be able to get to know alot of people in this community, and that we can help and motivate each other. </p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
