<p>As developers, we are constantly bombarded with distractions. Slack pings, email notifications, social media alerts... it never stops. That is why I built <strong><a href="https://monk-mode.lifestyle/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monk Mode</a></strong>. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Problem
</h2>

<p>Studies show the average developer is interrupted every <strong>11 minutes</strong>, and it takes <strong>23 minutes</strong> to fully regain focus. Do the math. We are losing hours of productive coding time every single day.</p>

<p>I noticed this pattern in my own workflow. I would sit down to code, get into flow state, then... <em>buzz</em>. A notification. A message. A quick check of Twitter that turns into 20 minutes of scrolling. Sound familiar?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What is Monk Mode?
</h2>

<p>Monk Mode is a digital detox and deep focus app designed for developers and knowledge workers who need uninterrupted time to do their best work.</p>

<p>Here is what it does:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Session Blocking</strong> - Block distracting apps during focus sessions</li>
<li>
<strong>Progress Tracking</strong> - Visualize your focus streaks over time</li>
<li>
<strong>Minimalist Design</strong> - No clutter, no bloat. Just focus.</li>
<li>
<strong>Accountability</strong> - Share your progress and stay consistent</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  The Philosophy
</h2>

<p>Monk Mode is not about becoming a hermit or deleting all your apps forever. It is about <strong>intentionally creating space</strong> for deep work. When you enter Monk Mode, you are making a commitment to yourself: for the next X hours, nothing gets through.</p>

<p>The best code is written in flow state. Monk Mode helps you get there and stay there.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why I Built This
</h2>

<p>I am a young developer who struggled with the same distractions everyone else faces. I tried Forest, Freedom, Cold Turkey... they all felt like they were fighting <em>against</em> me instead of working <em>with</em> me.</p>

<p>I wanted something that felt more like a philosophy than a tool. Something that made you actually <em>want</em> to focus, not just forced you to.</p>

<p>That is Monk Mode.</p>

<p>I would love to hear from other devs: <strong>What is your biggest distraction while coding, and how do you deal with it?</strong></p>
