<p>Traditional advice says practice one thing until you master it, then move to the next. Research says this is backwards.</p>

<p>Interleaving—mixing different topics or problem types during practice—produces better learning than blocked practice, even though it feels harder.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What Is Interleaving?
</h2>

<p><strong>Blocked practice:</strong> AAAA BBBB CCCC (master one type, then the next)<br>
<strong>Interleaved practice:</strong> ABCABCABCA (mix types throughout)</p>

<p>Example: Instead of doing 20 multiplication problems, then 20 division, mix them randomly.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why Interleaving Works
</h2>

<p><strong>Discrimination learning:</strong> Mixing forces your brain to identify WHICH strategy applies, not just HOW to execute one strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Retrieval practice:</strong> Each switch requires retrieving the relevant approach from memory, strengthening it.</p>

<p><strong>Spacing effect:</strong> Interleaving naturally spaces practice of each type.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Research
</h2>

<p>Studies consistently show interleaved practice produces 20-50% better performance on delayed tests, despite worse performance during practice.</p>

<p>In one study, students learning to identify painting styles performed 30% better when training was interleaved vs. blocked.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How to Implement Interleaving
</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Mix problem types</strong> in homework and practice sets</li>
<li>
<strong>Study multiple subjects</strong> in one session rather than marathoning one</li>
<li>
<strong>Randomize flashcard order</strong> rather than grouping by topic</li>
<li>
<strong>Combine old and new material</strong> in each practice session</li>
</ol>

<h2>
  
  
  When Interleaving Works Best
</h2>

<ul>
<li>After initial learning (you need some competence first)</li>
<li>For discriminating between similar concepts</li>
<li>For applying knowledge to novel situations</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  It Will Feel Harder
</h2>

<p>Interleaving produces more errors during practice. This is desirable difficulty—the struggle is the learning.</p>

<p>Trust the research over your feelings. Long-term retention matters more than practice performance.</p>
