<p><em>This is a submission for the <a href="https://dev.to/challenges/github-2026-01-21">GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge</a></em></p>

<h2>
  
  
  What I Built
</h2>

<p>There is no clean, simple, cross‑platform, developer‑friendly BLE CLI exists today. Linux has <code>bluetoothctl</code>, macOS has no official CLI, and Windows exposes only low‑level PowerShell APIs. </p>

<p>Developers working with BLE devices — especially ESP32‑based prototypes — lack a simple, unified, ergonomic CLI. My goal is to create a minimal, ergonomic, script‑friendly CLI for scanning, connecting, and interacting with BLE devices. </p>

  My Experience with GitHub Copilot CLI
</h2>

<p><code>bt</code> was built using the <code>copilot</code> which acted as a copilot for this project. It helped me in brainstorming, planning, rapid prototyping using natural language processing even with my typos :) </p>

<p>🤖 <code>copilot</code> helped in no context switching, focused development, acting as a pair programmer, testing, and more.</p>

<p>As a beginner in Bluetooth modules, it helped in navigating the docs, debugging, beautifying the output, and testing it. Without leaving the ide , it helped in polishing the whole project. </p>

<p>Here is how it started:</p>
