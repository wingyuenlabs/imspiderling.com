<p>Some would argue that rather than the ingredients themselves, a caesar salad is defined by balance, restraint, and intent.</p>

<p>Too much dressing, and it collapses into soup. Too many add-ons, and it stops being a Caesar altogether.</p>

<p>AI product development is currently hitting this exact failure mode.</p>

<p>Many product leads are realizing that their AI strategy looks less like a balanced dish and more like a pile of unidentifiable ingredients thrown into a bowl – generated quickly, assembled optimistically, and shipped under pressure.</p>

<p>The rise of vibe coding tools has accelerated this trend: features appear faster than teams can reason about them, and “working” is often mistaken for “ready.”</p>

<p>By ‘vibe coding,’ we mean generating functional code from high-level intent prompts, with minimal upfront design or system reasoning.</p>

<p>This isn’t a failure of tools; it’s a product leadership inflection point.</p>

<p>From Feature Owner to System Curator</p>

<p>Vibe coding tools have fundamentally altered the production layer of software.</p>

<p>Multiple teams report feeling up to 20% faster with AI assistance, yet paradoxically, complex task completion has slowed by nearly 19%.</p>

<p>Code churn — how often generated code is rewritten or reverted — has doubled since 2024. Resulting in more output but less coherence.</p>

<p>And this is where the product role is changing.</p>

<p>Historically, product managers translated business requirements into backlog items and validated outcomes through delivery. In a vibe-coded environment, that definition no longer holds. When code is cheap and abundant, the scarcest resource becomes intent.</p>

<p>The modern product lead is no longer just prioritising what gets built — but safeguarding why it exists, how it fits, and whether it should persist.</p>

<p><strong>Why This Lands on Product, Not Just Engineering</strong></p>

<p>In the traditional software era, engineering effort was the primary constraint.</p>

<p>Prioritization was a simple exercise in deciding what to build and when.</p>

<p>However, AI-accelerated development has flipped this script. When code becomes cheap and abundant, the true cost of a feature is no longer its creation; it’s long-term tax on the system.</p>

<p>In these environments, technical debt is no longer a “later” problem for engineering; it is an immediate product bottleneck that:</p>

<p>Recent data shows that while AI helps us ship faster, it often introduces a ‘maintenance tax’.</p>

<p>In fact, studies from early 2025 indicate that AI-generated pull requests contain about 1.7x more logic and correctness issues than those written by humans. This contributes to a nearly 40% spike in post-release costs as teams pivot from innovation to firefighting.</p>

<p>It sounds counterintuitive, but shipping too much unvetted code actually cuts market speed in half.</p>

<p>Eventually, the core of the product gets so fragile that adding even a small button feels like heart surgery.</p>

<p>When the roadmap is just a series of “reactive fire drills”, the team stops believing in the vision.</p>

<p>It’s hard to be “high-growth” when you’re constantly playing defense.</p>

<p>This transforms the product lead into the essential connective tissue between three critical tensions:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Human Intent vs. Machine Output:</strong> Bridging the gap between a high-level “vibe” and the deterministic code required for a production environment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rapid Experimentation vs. Long-term Viability:</strong> Ensuring that today’s “quick win” doesn’t become tomorrow’s structural failure.</li>
<li>
<strong>Local Feature Wins vs. Global System Health:</strong> Safeguarding the overall architecture from being diluted by a flood of disconnected, AI-generated components.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>

<p>We’re moving away from the era where “success” meant having a perfectly polished roadmap and sticking to it.</p>

<p>Instead, the job is becoming more about traceability – being able to look at a feature six months from now and actually understand why it was built and how it connects to everything else.</p>

<p>Just like a Caesar salad.</p>

<p>it’s not about how many ingredients you can fit in the bowl but rather about the discipline to leave things out so the flavors actually work together.</p>

<p>The debate isn’t about whether AI makes us faster. The real challenge for product leaders is: “Now that we can build everything instantly, how do we make sure we’re still building the right thing?”.</p>

<p>On 18 February 2026, we’re continuing this conversation by making it concrete — exploring what decision traceability looks like in practice, how system intelligibility is actively maintained, and how this shift in product strategy reshapes weekly rituals and review processes.</p>

<p>If you’re navigating AI-accelerated development and feeling the tension between shipping fast and holding the system together, this conversation is for you.</p>
