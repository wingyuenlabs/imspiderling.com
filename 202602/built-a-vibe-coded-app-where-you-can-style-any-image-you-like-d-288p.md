<p><strong><em>This is my submission to the GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge!</em></strong></p>




<h2>
  
  
  What I Built
</h2>

<p>This is my first time using the GitHub Copilot CLI! I believe doing this challenge will allow me to get exposure of using this CLI and how it help me in my development process.</p>

<p>I Vibe Coded a Web App that I called "<strong><em>ImageStyler</em></strong>" where you have the ability to upload any image and translate it into either ASCII or paint-like canvas themed. I built this app since it reminded me of doing an assignment for "<strong><em>Wed Design</em></strong>" where we have to scale our images/change colors for the web. One of the tools we used is "<strong><em>GIMP</em></strong>". Since I just started building this (Starting on Feb 5) and the deadline is in a couple of weeks, I thought to myself "Why not build that simple tool on the web?". This is built for fun and allow me to experience GitHub Copilot CLI.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Technologies used
</h2>

<p>This was built in Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. This was vibe coded using the GitHub Copilot CLI, so I am relying 99% of the copilot to do the work.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Demo
</h2>

<p>This is what the site looks like!<br>
<a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fwy0761clxp3oui065po4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fwy0761clxp3oui065po4.png" alt="Site" width="800" height="401"></a></p>

<h4>
  
  
  Drag and Drop image
</h4>

<p>You have the ability to drag/drop the image onto the box or click the button to select the image.<br>
<a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fk5jn89aebp4t7ajdlb2n.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fk5jn89aebp4t7ajdlb2n.gif" alt="Drop Image" width="426" height="240"></a></p>

<h4>
  
  
  ASCII Feature
</h4>

<p>One option is to translate the image to ASCII.<br>
<a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhdbpif3tjlcyr964u5qn.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhdbpif3tjlcyr964u5qn.gif" alt="ASCII" width="426" height="240"></a></p>

<h4>
  
  
  Paint Settings
</h4>

<p>The other option is to paint the image. For simplicity, this is what it looks like when you mix and convert the image.<br>
<a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9aho614wdn2ooli8mskm.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F9aho614wdn2ooli8mskm.gif" alt="Description of GIF" width="426" height="240"></a></p>

<h4>
  
  
  Download Modified Image
</h4>

<p>Once you are finished, you have the option to name the file and download your modified image.<br>
<a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Folrwbbvwr9ohtvb0maxy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Folrwbbvwr9ohtvb0maxy.gif" alt="Description of GIF" width="426" height="240"></a></p>

  My Experience with GitHub Copilot CLI
</h2>

<p>GitHub Copilot CLI in my Visual Studio Code has been really great (For a first timer using the CLI). Every time I request and feature or fix a bug, it tells me on the file on what are the changes that they made.</p>

<p>Additionally, it also ask me permission to execute the action. This only happens if it is running sensitive commands such as running a python server or fetching documentation from the web. It's always nice to ask for permission before executing the command.</p>

<p>Since it was vibe coded, I rely on the CLI to build this project in full. Unfortunately, I <strong>reached my limit</strong> for using the CLI since I was using the Free Tier. There are some challenges I faced though such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Asking too much</strong>. Since I was on a limit, I tried to cramp everything I want into one prompt. The problem is that it starts to get confused and got more errors. I then strategize how I can word it in a way where I can get the features I want while prompting as little as possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>GIF compatibility</strong>. GIF is not supported in this web app. Initially, it was built in-progress, but ran into issues where it does not do the GIF animation as well as not exporting as a GIF. Left that one out and only focusing on the image MVP. It is probably where I have too many requests in one prompt, but I believe adding the GIF functionality is possible and would be cool to see!</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless, I made some small changes and worked on the Readme.md file in my repository after I reached my limit of using the CLI.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great experience using the GitHub Copilot CLI in my Visual Studio Code! For future uses, I am thinking of using it as a mentor guide instead of using it to build the whole project code by code. It is very convenient and also a great learning tool (if asked!).</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Summary
</h2>

<p>It was a fun experience! My first time using this tool in the Visual Studio Code and would 100% recommend it!</p>
