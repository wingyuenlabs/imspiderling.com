<p>My time management app is finally in production. It combines the Pomodoro technique with a coffee-inspired aesthetic and smart automation.</p>

<p>🎯 What is The Coffee Timer?<br>
A web application that helps you stay focused with 25-minute work sessions, intelligent task management, and productivity insights.</p>

<p>✨ Key features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pomodoro timer with animated coffee cup visualization</li>
<li>Auto-start sessions - maintains your flow between work and breaks</li>
<li>Session feedback tracking - understand when you're most productive</li>
<li>Live timer in browser tab - no need to switch windows</li>
<li>Task management with priorities, tags, and categories</li>
<li>AI-powered daily summary and smart suggestions (Google Gemini)</li>
<li>Ambient sounds for better focus</li>
<li>Focus Mode for distraction-free work</li>
<li>Dark/light mode</li>
<li>PWA - works offline, installable as a native app</li>
<li>Google authentication</li>
<li>Premium subscription with advanced analytics via Stripe</li>
</ul>

<p>🛠️ Tech stack:<br>
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS<br>
Backend: .NET 8<br>
Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)<br>
AI: Google Gemini API<br>
Payments: Stripe</p>

<p>This project taught me about Stripe payment integration, JWT authentication, generative AI APIs, real-time browser tab updates, and building smooth UX flows that reduce friction instead of adding it.</p>

<p>The biggest lesson? Shipping version 1.0 with core features beats waiting for perfection.</p>
