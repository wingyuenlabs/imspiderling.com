<p>I’ve been working on a Kaggle notebook designed as a multi-purpose analytical dashboard — something closer to a Swiss Army knife than a single-use analysis.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on one dataset or one model, the goal was different:</p>

<p>Bring multiple analytical utilities into one structured environment<br>
Emphasize clarity, visualization, and decision-ready insight**<br>
Treat the notebook as a working tool, not just an academic exercise</p>

<p>While developing it, an important idea kept coming back to me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the AI-accelerated era, the real value may no longer be writing isolated code,<br>
but designing useful analytical systems people can actually use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I’d like to open this as a discussion with the DEV community:</p>

<p>What separates a useful data tool from just another notebook?<br>
Do integrated analytical dashboards have real value in professional workflows?<br>
What would you improve first — architecture, performance, UX, or modeling depth?</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in exploring the notebook itself, I’d genuinely value your technical perspective:</p>

<p>All thoughtful feedback is welcome — especially from engineers and data professionals thinking about how analytics tools should evolve in 2026.</p>
