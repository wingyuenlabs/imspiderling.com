<p>Notes from a frontend engineerâ€™s journey.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m Alexey, a frontend engineer who spends most of my time wrangling JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, React, and Node.js. I've been in webdev for 15+ years, but not good at blogging. Maybe that's a time to start.</p>

<p>This blog isnâ€™t meant to be super serious â€” itâ€™s just a place where Iâ€™ll drop ideas, random thoughts, and lessons Iâ€™ve picked up along the way. If even one of them helps someone out, thatâ€™s a win. ðŸ™Œ</p>

<p>Iâ€™m always up for chatting about web development and learning from others.<br>
Letâ€™s trade ideas and see what we can learn from each other.</p>

<p>â€” Alexey</p>
