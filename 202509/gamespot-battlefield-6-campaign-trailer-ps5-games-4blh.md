<p>Battlefield 6 revives its global-scale single-player action, putting you in the boots of Dagger 13, an elite Marine Raider squad hell-bent on toppling the mercenary force Pax Armata. Expect heart-pounding set pieces from storming Gibraltar’s beaches to street-by-street firefights in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Beyond the glamour of HALO jumps into hostile zones, this campaign promises full-on destruction, massive environments, and that signature squad play that forces you to make every move count. It’s Battlefield, dialed up to 11.</p>
