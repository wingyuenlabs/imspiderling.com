<p>Hey HN! I built an email verification API that actually does more than check if an email looks valid. It combines machine learning risk scoring with real SMTP validation to give you better insight into email quality.<br>
What's Different<br>
Most email validators just tell you "valid" or "invalid". Mine gives you a risk score, explains why, AND tells you whether you should actually send to that email. Like "Don't send - suspicious due to new domain registration" or "Safe to send - verified corporate email". Plus it does the usual SMTP checks - MX records, mailbox verification, catching disposables and role accounts.<br>
The bulk verification handles large lists without timing out, which was a pain point I had with other services.<br>
Why Risk Scoring + Reasoning<br>
Basic verification: "Does this email exist?"<br>
With risk scoring + explanations: "Should I trust this email, and here's exactly why you might not want to."<br>
Having the reasoning helps with:</p>

<p>Manual review decisions (you know what to look for)<br>
Building automated rules for your specific use case<br>
Understanding patterns in your user base<br>
Explaining decisions to stakeholders</p>

<p>Real-World Use Cases</p>

<p>SaaS onboarding (auto-approve low risk, manual review high risk)<br>
E-commerce fraud prevention<br>
Cleaning marketing lists before campaigns<br>
User registration workflows</p>
