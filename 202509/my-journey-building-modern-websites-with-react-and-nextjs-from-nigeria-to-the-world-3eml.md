<p>Hi, I’m Gideon Abe, a web developer based in Nigeria who’s passionate about building fast, high-converting websites using React and Next.js. Over the last few years, I’ve worked on more than 15 projects for clients both locally and internationally, focusing on performance, SEO, and accessibility.</p>

<p><strong>How It All Started</strong></p>

<p>My journey began with a curiosity about how websites work and how to make them better. I started learning JavaScript and React through online tutorials and small projects. What fascinated me was the ability to create user-friendly, efficient websites that could help businesses grow and reach more people.</p>

<p><strong>Growing My Skills Through Real Projects</strong></p>

<p>I didn’t stop at just learning — I took on real projects for startups, small businesses, and personal brands. Each project taught me something new about building scalable, SEO-friendly, and accessible websites. Working with different clients across industries has helped me understand diverse needs and how to tailor solutions accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Why React and Next.js?</strong></p>

<p>React’s component-based architecture allows me to build reusable, maintainable UI components, while Next.js adds powerful features like server-side rendering and static site generation. These tools enable me to create websites that load fast, perform well on search engines, and provide great user experiences.</p>

<p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>

<p>I’m continually learning and expanding my skills to stay on top of web technologies and best practices. My goal is to help more businesses and individuals establish a strong online presence with modern, efficient websites.</p>
