<p>Even the pros can’t break par at this famously brutal course, and in his final tournament of the year our host is taking on the only track in the world where sub-par is pure legend.</p>

<p>Big shoutout to channel partner Shot Scope for boosting his game—check out their distance-measuring devices at shotscope.com/uk—and grab all his clothes and gear (with discounts!) via his Linktree at linktr.ee/finchgolfmedia.</p>
