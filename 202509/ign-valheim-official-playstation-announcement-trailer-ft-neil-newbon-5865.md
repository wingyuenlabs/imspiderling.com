<p>Fancy a trip to the Viking afterlife? The new PlayStation trailer for Valheim (voiced by Neil Newbon) shows off base-building, resource gathering and brutal boss fights in a procedurally generated Norse world. Iron Gate ABâ€™s open-world survival-crafting gem challenges you to carve out your own refuge and take on the forces of the tenth world.</p>

<p>Valheim lands on PS5 in 2026, but you can already brave its misty meadows and savage seas on Xbox One, Series X|S or PC via Steam. Time to sharpen that axe and set sail!</p>
