<h2>
  
  
  TL;DR
</h2>

<p>Bryan Bros took golf to the next level by roping in llamas as caddies, leading to hilariously chaotic rounds (special thanks to Mark, Sandy and Eggs for making it happen!). Along the way they plug their newsletter, Discord and Twitch, plus show off all their favorite gear—launch monitors, rangefinders, putters and more—complete with discount codes and affiliate links.</p>
