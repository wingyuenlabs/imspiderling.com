<p>Wanted to hear from as a newbie some of the biggest projects my fellow programmers have taken and how they overcame different challenges in their field. </p>

<p>How confident do you think if you were to attempt it again, don't be shy to share something that maybe not as challenging to others. I welcome anybody of any experience level to share!</p>
