<p>Ghost of Yōtei drops you into the shoes of Atsu, a fierce new protagonist driven by a thirst for revenge. You’ll journey through Feudal Japan’s stunning landscapes—where cherry-blossom beauty collides with brutal violence—and uncover the dark motivations that fuel Atsu’s quest.</p>

<p>This revenge tale keeps things gripping from start to finish, blending moments of serene wonder with raw, savage action. It’s a poetic yet punishing look at an era where honor and bloodshed walk hand in hand.</p>
