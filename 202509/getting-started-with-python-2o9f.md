<p>Hi, I'm Will and this is my first blog post on Dev. I have been dabbling with coding for a few years, mainly with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but after doing more research I have decided to focus on Python, particularly automation and scripting.</p>

<p>I like the idea of learning to simplify and automate boring, repetitive tasks and making workflows more efficient. Also, Python is a very versatile language and it can open up a lot of options and career paths, if I decide to explore another niche later on. </p>

<p>My main goal with this blog is consistency. I have struggled to stick with goals in the past so I plan on making at least one post a week to document my progress and explain what I have learned so far. Not only will this help build consistency, but by breaking down what I have learned I will be using the Feynman Technique to help solidify my knowledge, and hopefully help others learn in the process. </p>

<p>Instead of bouncing around between multiple resources and tutorials, this time I've picked one resource to get started with and stick to. Right now I'm working my way through <a href="https://youtu.be/nLRL_NcnK-4" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python course</a> that's available for free on Youtube. I'm also practicing with some small, simple programs to get started coding right away, which I plan on discussing in my next post.  </p>
