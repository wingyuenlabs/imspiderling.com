  Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds – TL;DR
</h2>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is SEGA’s new arcade-style racer where Sonic and a cast of SEGA (and surprise guest) characters collide in multi-dimensional tracks packed with crazy power-ups and wild shortcuts. The official launch trailer teases gravity-defying drifts, team boosts, and cross-franchise face-offs that crank the competition up to eleven.</p>

<p>Mark your calendars for September 25—CrossWorlds races onto PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch (and Switch 2), plus PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store.  </p>
