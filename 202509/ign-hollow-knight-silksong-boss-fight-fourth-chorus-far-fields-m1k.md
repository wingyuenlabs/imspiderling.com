  Hollow Knight: Silksong Boss Fight – Fourth Chorus (Far Fields)
</h1>

<p>You tackle the Fourth Chorus boss right after grabbing the Drifter’s Cloak, swinging at its head until the final phase. At 2:22 you unlock two wind gusts that let you blast the arena’s explosive at the top for a flashy finish.</p>

<p>Spoiler: You do end up dying in the blast, but still get credit for the win. For more tips and lore, hit up the IGN wiki!</p>
