  Hollow Knight: Silksong Review
</h1>

<p>Silksong builds on the original’s magic with a tighter story, more guided exploration, and Hornet’s newfound acrobatics that smooth out the toughest platforming moments. You’ll still dive headfirst into sprawling caverns and mysterious kingdoms, but now you do it with a bit more grace—and a lot less frustration.</p>

<p>It may feel like a “safer” sequel thanks to its polished design and approachable tweaks, but make no mistake: this is every bit as essential and thrilling as the first Hollow Knight. Waiting for Hornet’s tale was more than worth it.</p>
