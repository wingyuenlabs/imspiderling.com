  The Music Theory of Silksong’s Bone Bottom Theme
</h1>

<p>8-bit Music Theory dives into the haunting charm of Bone Bottom by comparing it with the original Dirtmouth theme. You’ll learn how that sorrowful b6 tone sets the mood, why the composer sticks to a rock-solid chord structure (even if it means bending the key), and what the B section adds to the mix.</p>

<p>Along the way, the video timestamps each deep-dive—from the “sad, sad b6” and consistent chord progressions to the strategic key sacrifices—and wraps up by contrasting how Dirtmouth and Bone Bottom each tug at your heartstrings in their own way.</p>
