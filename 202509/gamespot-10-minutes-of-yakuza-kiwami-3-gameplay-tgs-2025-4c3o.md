  Yakuza Kiwami 3 TGS 2025 Gameplay Preview
</h2>

<p>RGG Studios just unleashed a 10-minute sneak peek of Yakuza Kiwami 3 at TGS 2025, and it’s a wild ride from start to finish. You’ll dive headfirst into two intense street fights, belt out tunes at karaoke, and even grab snacks at the local convenience store. </p>

<p>Beyond the brawls and ballads, the demo serves up some chill slice-of-life moments: buying and savoring lunch, swapping into a fresh outfit, and capping it all off with a slick story cutscene that hints at the next big chapter in Kiryu’s saga.</p>
