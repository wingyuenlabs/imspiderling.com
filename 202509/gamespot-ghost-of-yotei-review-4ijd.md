<p>Ghost of Yōtei drops you into Atsu’s shoes, a fresh-faced protagonist driven by revenge in a beautifully rendered Feudal Japan. The narrative hooks you with emotional stakes and layered characters.  </p>

<p>The game masterfully contrasts serene, cherry-blossomed vistas with raw, fierce battles, crafting an immersive experience where beauty and brutality collide.</p>
