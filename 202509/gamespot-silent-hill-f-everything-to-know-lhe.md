  Silent Hill F – TL;DR
</h2>

<p>Silent Hill F marks the franchise’s comeback after more than a decade, crafted by a Japan-based studio of survival-horror veterans. It’s the first mainline entry to leave the misty streets of Maine behind and plunge you into a brand-new nightmare in rural Japan.</p>

<p>Expect fresh scares, eerie folklore twists and classic Silent Hill dread—only with a uniquely Japanese twist on the series’ signature atmosphere.</p>
