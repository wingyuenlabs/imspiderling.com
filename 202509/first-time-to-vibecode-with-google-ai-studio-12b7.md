<p>I was able to build an app for the first time. Its not that fancy but it works for me at least.</p>

<p>It is a note-taking app. (I know its always been this app)</p>

<p>I have previously tried other tools like bolt, lovable but man Google did amazing on this.</p>

<p>No login required. Data is Saved only to your local machine/browser but you can download all your notes for backup.</p>

<p>I am always looking for a note taking app that is simple but functional. Not too many clutter or confusing commands.</p>

<p>I just exported the files from Google AI Studio and made a repo on github though right now it is private but let me know your thoughts about it.</p>

<p>I am open to any comments or suggestions or bug fixes. Thank you!</p>
