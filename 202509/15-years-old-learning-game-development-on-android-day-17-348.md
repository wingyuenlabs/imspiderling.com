<p>Day 17 of my 60 Days Game Development On Android Challenge</p>

<p>Today my project finally came to life! ðŸŽ‰<br>
I added all my assets; images, fonts, music, and sound effects<br>
And then jumped into coding.<br>
I wrote  files like player.py, enemy.py, and main.py, I loaded everything together in Pygame. then I ran it</p>

<p>The best part? Seeing objects move smoothly on screen and hearing the sounds trigger perfectly. My little game feels alive now! ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¥</p>
