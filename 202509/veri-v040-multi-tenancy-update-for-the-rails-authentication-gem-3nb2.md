<p>We just released <a href="https://github.com/brownboxdev/veri" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veri v0.4.0</a>, introducing multi-tenancy support. Now you can isolate authentication sessions per tenant, whether that’s a subdomain or a model representing an organization.</p>

<p>This update also adds several useful scopes and renames a couple of methods.</p>

<p>⚠️The gem is still in early development, so expect breaking changes in minor versions until v1.0!</p>
