<p><em>Game Theory</em> takes a deep dive into just how devastating Donkey Kong’s punch really is—tracing its Smash Bros. roots and cranking up the power even further in the upcoming Donkey Kong Bananza on Switch. Expect a wild physics breakdown that might have you wondering if DK could punch holes through mountains (or at least ruin a few unsuspecting barrels).</p>

<p>Along the way, MatPat shouts out sponsors like Boot.Dev (grab 25% off with code THEGAMETHEORISTS) and Theorywear merch, plus props to writers Tom Robinson &amp; Zaech Stew, editors Axellent, Koen Verhagen, Marc Schneider &amp; Jerika, and sound maestro Yosi Berman for making this theory-packed episode happen.</p>
