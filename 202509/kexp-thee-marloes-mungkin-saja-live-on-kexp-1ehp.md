<p><strong>Thee Marloes</strong> hit the KEXP studio on August 1, 2025, for a spirited live take on “Mungkin Saja.” Fronted by Natassya Sianturi (vocals/keys) alongside Sinatrya Dharaka (guitar/vox), Tommy Satrio (drums), Rhesa Filbert (bass/vox) and Sandy Kusuma (percussion/vox), the session was captured by host Larry Mizell, Jr., engineered by Kevin Suggs and polished by mastering guru Matt Ogaz.</p>

<p>A five-camera setup (Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen, Jonathan Jacobson &amp; Luke Knecht) rolled as Luke Knecht handled the edit.
