  Thee Marloes – “Over” (Live on KEXP)
</h1>

<p>KEXP hosted Thee Marloes in their Seattle studio on August 1, 2025 for a live take on “Over.” Fronted by Natassya Sianturi (vocals/keys) alongside Sinatrya Dharaka (guitar), Rhesa Filbert (bass), Tommy Satrio (drums) and Sandy Kusuma (percussion), the Indonesian outfit brings a fresh, dynamic energy to the session.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Larry Mizell Jr. steered the show while Kevin Suggs handled audio engineering and Matt Ogaz took care of mastering. Camera work was shared by Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen, Jonathan Jacobson and Luke Knecht (who also edited).
