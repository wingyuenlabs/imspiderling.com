<p>Hello everyone! This week I began my <strong>daily learning journey</strong> — diving into <strong>System Design concepts</strong> (via the roadmap.sh System Design Roadmap) and solving <strong>DSA challenges</strong> on LeetCode.</p>

<p>✅ <strong>7 days straight</strong> of showing up. Here are the highlights:</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🏗 System Design Concepts Covered
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Latency vs Throughput</strong> → Learned how speed (latency) and volume (throughput) trade off in system performance.</li>
<li>
<strong>Consistency Patterns</strong> → Strong, Weak, and Eventual — and where each makes sense (finance vs gaming vs social media).</li>
<li>
<strong>Availability Patterns</strong> → Redundancy, Replication, Load Balancing, Circuit Breakers, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Failover</strong> → Active-passive vs active-active setups, and why resilience always adds complexity.</li>
</ul>

<p>💡 <strong>Biggest Insight:</strong> System Design is about trade-offs, not absolutes. You never get high availability, high consistency, and high performance all at once.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  💻 DSA Problems Tackled
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Regular Expression Matching</strong> (hard) → Recursive approach stretched my thinking.</li>
<li>
<strong>Integer ↔ Roman Conversions</strong> → Dictionary lookups + loops made the logic clean.</li>
<li>
<strong>Longest Common Prefix</strong> → Sorting trick was an elegant win.</li>
</ul>

<p>💡 <strong>Biggest Insight:</strong> For DSA, sometimes brute force teaches you the problem space — but the best solutions come from reframing (like sorting or recursion).</p>




<h2>
  
  
  🏆 Week 1 Reflections
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Showed up <strong>daily</strong> despite challenges (some problems took 2–3 hours).</li>
<li>Learned to balance <strong>deep dives</strong> (like regex recursion) with <strong>practical clarity</strong> (like Roman numeral conversions).</li>
<li>Seeing <strong>patterns</strong> emerge between System Design and DSA: both are about trade-offs and structured problem solving.</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  🚀 What’s Next (Week 2 Goals)
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Push into <strong>more advanced system design topics</strong> (e.g., gRPC, DB sharding, caching strategies).</li>
<li>Continue solving <strong>medium/hard LeetCode problems</strong>, but improve on <strong>timeboxing</strong> solutions.</li>
<li>Start sharing <strong>shorter code insights</strong> to make posts even more practical for readers.</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  🤝 Let’s Connect!
</h2>

<p>That’s <strong>Week 1 in the books 🎉</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’ve been following along, I’d love to hear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which <strong>System Design trade-off</strong> do you find most challenging in real projects?</li>
<li>What’s your <strong>DSA strategy</strong> — brute force first or optimal-first thinking?</li>
<li>Or just drop a 💡 to celebrate learning and consistency!</li>
</ul>

<p>Your engagement helps me keep momentum, and I’d love to make Week 2 even better — for me and for everyone reading 🚀.</p>
