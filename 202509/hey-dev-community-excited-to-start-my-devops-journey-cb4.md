<p>Hi everyone!<br>
I’m Sheersh Sinha, a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Cyber Security from SRM Institute of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>I’ve had the opportunity to work as a Security Analyst Trainee at Tracelay Networks, where I gained hands-on experience with threat detection, endpoint security, and incident response. While this experience strengthened my foundation in security, I realized my real passion lies in DevOps and Cloud technologies.</p>

<p>🌱 My DevOps Learning Journey</p>

<p>I’ve decided to start my DevOps journey from the ground up, and my blogs here will cover concepts step by step — starting from the basics and moving into advanced topics. Some of the areas I’ll be writing about include:</p>

<p>🐧 Linux &amp; Networking — the essentials every DevOps engineer needs.</p>

<p>☁️ AWS Services — cloud foundations and deployments.</p>

<p>🛠 Build Tools — learning to automate and optimize builds.</p>

<p>🐳 Docker &amp; Kubernetes — containers, orchestration, and microservices.</p>

<p>🔄 Git/GitHub — collaboration and version control.</p>

<p>📚 SDLC &amp; DevOps Practices — bridging development and operations.</p>

<p>⚙️ Jenkins &amp; Ansible — automating pipelines and configurations.</p>

<p>🏗 AWS CloudFormation — infrastructure as code.</p>

<p>📊 Prometheus &amp; Grafana — monitoring and observability.</p>

<p>📂 Sharing Projects Along the Way</p>

<p>I believe the best way to learn is by building. That’s why I’ll also be posting projects I work on — from CI/CD pipelines to monitoring dashboards — so you can see how concepts turn into practical implementations.</p>

<p>✍️ What to Expect From My Blogs</p>

<p>Beginner-friendly explanations of DevOps tools.</p>

<p>Step-by-step tutorials with commands, configs, and visuals.</p>

<p>Hands-on projects and experiments from my journey.</p>

<p>A perspective that combines DevOps + Security (DevSecOps).</p>

<p>🤝 Let’s Connect!</p>

<p>I’m here to learn, share, and grow with the DEV Community.</p>
