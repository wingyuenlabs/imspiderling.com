<p>Breaking Into Tech in Nigeria: It’s Tough… But Totally Worth It 💻🇳🇬</p>

<p>When I started learning web development and AI, I quickly realized: the journey isn’t easy.</p>

<p>🚫 Challenges we face as beginners:</p>

<p>Unstable internet &amp; power outages ⚡</p>

<p>Limited access to mentorship &amp; quality courses 📚</p>

<p>Employers wanting experience we don’t have yet 🎯</p>

<p>AI has made it way easier to learn to code<br>
✅ But the opportunities are massive:</p>

<p>Remote work &amp; freelancing let you earn globally 🌍</p>

<p>Free resources like freeCodeCamp, YouTube, and Coursera make self-learning possible</p>

<p>Tech communities are gold mines for mentorship, support &amp; networking 🤝</p>

<p>Here’s my advice:<br>
1️⃣ Start building projects—even small ones.<br>
2️⃣ Share your journey online; it attracts opportunities.<br>
3️⃣ Network like crazy. Connect, ask questions, and engage.<br>
4️⃣ Be consistent. Learning 1 hour a day compounds more than you think.</p>

<p>Nigeria’s tech ecosystem is growing faster than ever. The doors are open—you just need to take the first step.</p>
