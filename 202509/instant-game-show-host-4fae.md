<p><em>This is a submission for the <a href="https://dev.to/challenges/google-ai-studio-2025-09-03">Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge</a></em></p>

  What I Built
</h2>

<p>It is a trivia game that generates roastful questions about an image of a person you uploaded. As you can see, we use big Elon because why not? But you can totally upload yourself, and Gemini will try to challenge your hairline or something. </p>

  How I Used Google AI Studio
</h2>

<p>I suffered. I suffered, but I used the AI studio. I made Gemini write all the code. It kept ruining it. I kept providing docs and curses to steer it. It kept trying to make my life miserable. It was a painful experience. Only the image of Pepe helped me in this endeavour. Thank you, Pepe. And, jokes aside, AI Studio is a nice tool that is just a bit rough on the edges. You should give it a try if you haven't.</p>
