On August 4, 2025, Cory Hanson dropped a spirited live rendition of “Lou Reed” in the KEXP studio, handling guitar, piano and vocals alongside Evan Backer on drums and Hazel Rigby on bass.  </p>

<p>Behind the scenes, host Jewel Loree guided the session while Julian Martlew and Jon Roberts manned the boards and Matt Ogaz handled mastering. A four-person camera crew led by Jim Beckmann captured every moment, edited by Scott Holpainen, and the whole thing is streaming on KEXP’s channels.</p>
