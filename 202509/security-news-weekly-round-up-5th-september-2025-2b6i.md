<p>A case of patched vulnerability, a record-breaking DDoS, and detection of phishing pages. These are what we'll review today, reminding us that cyber threats are evolving and defenders are doing their best to keep their users safe.</p>

<p>Let's begin.</p>

  <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/08/whatsapp-issues-emergency-update-for.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp Patches Zero-Click Exploit Targeting iOS and macOS Devices</a>
</h2>

<p>From the article's title, it's evident that WhatsApp has patched the exploited vulnerability. Also, from reading the article, I learned that some were targeted and WhatsApp sent an in-app threat notification to them.</p>

<p>What can we learn from this? Here you go:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vulnerability in question is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the ImageIO framework that could result in memory corruption when processing a malicious image.</p>
</blockquote>

  <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/cloudflare-blocks-record-11-5-tbps-ddos-attack/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare Blocks Record-Breaking 11.5 Tbps DDoS Attack</a>
</h2>

<p>Every time I read articles about DDoS attacks, I just remember the DDoS attacks of 2016 powered by the Mirai botnet. Now, 9 years later, those attacks might look like child's play. Luckily (or not), this attack lasted for, wait for it, 35 seconds. But, without the protections offered by Cloudflare, who knows what the effects might be? Hopefully, we never find out.</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This record-setting DDoS attack takes the lead as the largest in history roughly three months after Cloudflare blocked a 7.3 Tbps DDoS attack. Seen in mid-May, the assault targeted a hosting provider and lasted for only 45 seconds. Approximately 37.4 Tb of traffic, or the equivalent of over 9,000 HD movies, was delivered in the timeframe.</p>

</h2>

<p>This detection reminds me that although platforms like VirusTotal help users scan applications that have known malware strains, it can also help in detecting those that are yet to be flagged by security vendors. An example is this one.</p>

<p>Reading through the article, it also shows that the phishing web pages use social engineering to silently download an additional ZIP archive, but at the time of writing, there are no further details on this.</p>

<p>The following is the takeaway from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The disclosure comes as cracked versions of legitimate software and ClickFix-style tactics are being used to lure users into infecting their Apple macOS systems with an information stealer called Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), exposing businesses to credential stuffing, financial theft, and other follow-on attacks.</p>
