  Thee Marloes Live on KEXP
</h1>

<p>Thee Marloes stormed KEXP’s studio on August 1, 2025, serving up five killer tracks—Logika, Over, Not Today, Mungkin Saja and I’d Be Lost—with Larry Mizell, Jr. on hosting duties and Kevin Suggs and Matt Ogaz handling the sound.  </p>

<p>Featuring Natassya Sianturi (vocals/keys), Sinatrya Dharaka (guitar/vox), Tommy Satrio (drums), Rhesa Filbert (bass/vox) and Sandy Kusuma (percussion/vox), this five-piece brought raw energy and tight grooves. Catch the full session on KEXP’s YouTube or dive deeper on their Bandcamp.</p>
