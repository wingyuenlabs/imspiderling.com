<p>Ghost of Yōtei throws you into the shoes of Atsu, a fresh-faced protagonist hell-bent on settling the score. You’ll slice through enemies, sneak past guards and uncover secrets as you chase down those who wronged you.</p>

<p>Set against a backdrop of Feudal Japan, the game masterfully balances serene beauty—like misty mountain shrines and blooming cherry trees—with brutal, blood-soaked combat. If you’re into revenge tales wrapped in samurai lore, Atsu’s journey is a must-play.</p>
