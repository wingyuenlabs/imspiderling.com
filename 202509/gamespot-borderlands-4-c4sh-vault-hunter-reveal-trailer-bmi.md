<p><strong>Borderlands 4 just rolled out C4SH</strong>, a dice-and-cards-obsessed Vault Hunter unveiled at Tokyo Game Show 2025. He’s dropping in Q1 2026 as part of Story Pack 1: <em>Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned</em>—unlockable by upgrading to the Super Deluxe Edition, snagging the Vault Hunter Pack, or buying the story pack on its own.</p>

<p>Expect the usual Borderlands mayhem on planet Kairos: wage war on the tyrannical Timekeeper solo or with up to three friends, rack up billions of loot drops, and enjoy fresh traversal tricks (double jumps, gliding, fixed-point grappling and more) alongside over-the-top enemies, epic boss fights and new cosmetics.</p>
