<p>If you’re preparing for campus placements, you’ve probably faced this classic dilemma:<br>
Should you spend hours on competitive programming (CP) platforms like LeetCode or Codeforces, or put that time into building cool projects on GitHub?</p>

<p>I struggled with the same question back in college. On one hand, CP gives you the speed and accuracy to survive those tough coding rounds. On the other hand, projects add real weight to your resume and prove you can actually build something useful.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll share what worked for me and what I’ve noticed in the industry. We’ll look at the pros and cons of both paths, when one can give you an edge over the other, and how you can strike the right balance without burning out.</p>

<p>Spoiler: you don’t really have to pick just one, the best results usually come from mixing both.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Understanding Competitive Programming
</h2>

<p>Competitive programming is like a mental gym where you solve algorithmic puzzles under time pressure. Think optimizing code, wrestling with data structures like trees or graphs, and debugging on the fly. Platforms like <strong>Codeforces</strong> and <strong>HackerRank</strong> host contests that mimic the coding tests you’ll face in job interviews.</p>

<p>Why CP matters for placements: It sharpens your problem-solving skills, which are critical for technical interviews. Product-based companies like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft often start their hiring with coding rounds focused on <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</strong>. CP trains you to think fast and write clean, efficient code.</p>

<p>I’ve heard friends who landed FAANG roles say their LeetCode streaks were a game-changer. A high rating on platforms like Codeforces can also make your resume compelling, it’s like a shiny badge showing you’re quick on your feet. But here’s the catch: CP can eat up hours, and if you’re just memorizing patterns without understanding the logic, it might not stick. Some hiring managers even argue CP is more of a hobby than a job skill, though it’s undeniably a boost for entry-level roles.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Power of Building Projects
</h2>

<p>Projects are all about turning your coding knowledge into something impactful. Whether it’s a full-stack web app, an AI chatbot, or a mobile game, projects let you play with tools like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, or <strong>Python libraries</strong>. You host them on GitHub, write a solid README, and voilà , you’ve got proof you can build stuff that works.</p>

<p>Why projects shine for placements: Service-based companies (like TCS or Infosys) and startups value practical skills over pure algo skills. Projects show you can work in a team, tackle real-world bugs, and deploy something users can interact with.</p>

<p>I remember working on a personal project, a simple e-commerce site with user login and payment features and it ended up being the highlight of my behavioral round. Recruiters really enjoy hearing, I built this from scratch, and here’s how I scaled it.That said, projects take time and planning. A basic to-do list app won’t stand out, but a well-documented, unique project shows creativity and initiative in a way CP might not.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Which Wins for Placements?
</h2>

<p>It depends on your target:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Product-based companies</strong> (Google, Amazon, etc.): Lean heavier on CP, think a <strong>70/30 split</strong>. Their interviews are DSA-heavy, and CP preps you for that pressure. Devs on Reddit (like in r/cscareerquestions) swear by CP for getting through the door, though projects help in later rounds.</li>
<li>
<strong>Service-based firms or startups</strong>: Flip it to <strong>60/40 projects</strong>. They care about your ability to hit the ground running with tech stacks. CP gets your foot in, but projects sustain your career.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2025, with AI tools making coding faster, projects that use trending tech like ML models or blockchain are more valuable than ever. On X, students are starting competitive programming earlier to skip the last-minute rush, and they’re also turning hackathons into opportunities to showcase projects that boost their resumes.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How to Balance Both (Without Losing Your Mind)
</h2>

<p>You don’t have to choose sides, do both smartly. Start with CP to build a strong DSA foundation, then apply it in projects. For example, use dynamic programming from CP to optimize a feature in your app. Aim for <strong>2-3 solid projects</strong> (well-documented, not overly complex) and consistent CP practice (1-2 problems a day).</p>

<p>Here’s what worked for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Mornings</strong>: Tackle 1-2 LeetCode medium problems.</li>
<li>
<strong>Evenings</strong>: Work on project features or documentation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Weekends</strong>: Join hackathons (check Devpost or MLH) for a mix of both.</li>
</ul>

<p>Start early, don’t wait for placement season. And pick your language wisely: </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Wrapping It Up
</h2>

<p>Neither CP nor projects is “more important”, it’s about what fits your goals. CP gives you an edge in coding tests; projects prove you’re a well-rounded dev. Blend them, and you’re unstoppable. I landed my first job because I had both: CP got me the interview, projects sealed the deal. Focus on enjoying the process, burnout is real.</p>
