<p>“Why do I write?” That’s the question I asked myself recently. The answer is simple, yet deeply personal: I write because the craft of software engineering — the pride in building something elegant, thoughtful, and well-designed — has largely disappeared from the tech industry in 2025.</p>

I realized that without that sense of craftsmanship, my work felt like a series of tasks rather than a practice that challenges me, excites me, and makes me feel fulfilled.</p>
