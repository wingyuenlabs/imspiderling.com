<p>Nioh 3 just dropped its release-date trailer during State of Play 2025, and it looks insanely brutal. Youâ€™ll slash, parry, and unleash new weapon combos as you trek through fiery valleys, misty forests, and other deadly landscapes.</p>

<p>Mark your calendars: the next chapter of this dark samurai saga arrives on PS5 on February 6. Time to sharpen those blades!</p>
