<p>High Halls is easily one of the toughest arenas in Hollow Knight: Silksong, so feel free to wait until you’ve got two Nail upgrades before tackling it. You’ll need to juggle multiple waves of enemies, conserve your Silk for healing, and hold onto your Cogfly and Cogwork Wheel until the final wave to blast through quickly.</p>

<p>Load out with the Hunter Crest for extra damage, toss Cogflys for ranged hits, and pick Rune Rage as your Ability since it packs a serious punch. Don’t forget Druid’s Eye for that extra healing boost, plus Weavelight, Compass and Magnetite Brooch to keep you on point.</p>
