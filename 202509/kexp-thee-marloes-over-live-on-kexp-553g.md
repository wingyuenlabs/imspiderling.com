</h1>

<p>On August 1, 2025, KEXP welcomed Indonesian indie outfit Thee Marloes into their Seattle studio for a vibrant live take on <em>Over</em>. Natassya Sianturi’s soaring vocals and keys, Sinatrya Dharaka’s chiming guitar, Rhesa Filbert’s bass, Sandy Kusuma’s percussion and backing vocals, plus Tommy Satrio’s driving drums made for an irresistible nine-minute jam.</p>

<p>Hosted by Larry Mizell, Jr. and sonically sculpted by engineer Kevin Suggs with mastering by Matt Ogaz, the session was captured by Jim Beckmann, Carlos Cruz, Scott Holpainen, Jonathan Jacobson and Luke Knecht (who also handled editing).
