<p>Here’s a quick rundown of “The War Songs of Greenwich Village”: it’s basically a shout-out to the new anthology “Century of Song,” which collects some of the most influential tunes from the last 100 years. You’ll find handy links to pick it up at Barnes &amp; Noble, Blackwells, Amazon, or Indigo.</p>

<p>Bonus track alert! If you’re curious about traditional Irish balladry, check out Dancing Willow’s demo of “The Foggy Dew” over on Wikimedia Commons.</p>
