  TL;DR

<p>MatPat’s latest Game Theory episode tackles one of gaming’s biggest questions: just how destructive is Donkey Kong’s signature punch? He breaks down the physics behind DK’s smash attacks in Super Smash Bros. and applies those numbers to his new outing in Donkey Kong Bananza, showing you whether that mighty fist could really obliterate steel, stone, or anything else that dares stand in its way.</p>

<p>Along the way you’ll catch sponsor shout-outs (Boot.Dev’s got you covered with a 25% discount using code <strong>THEGAMETHEORISTS</strong>), plus all the credits to the brains and talent that made the video possible.</p>
