<p><strong>Chainsaw Man’s</strong> dub recap slashes through Denji’s wild origin: once a debt-ridden yakuza devil hunter, he’s betrayed, killed, and reborn when his trusty devil-dog Pochita merges with him—chainsaws, blood, and all. With devils, hunters, and secret foes tearing the world apart, a mysterious new player named Reze turns Denji’s life (and heart) upside down.</p>

<p>Mark your calendars for October 24, 2025, when <strong>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</strong> revs into theaters! Adapted from Tatsuki Fujimoto’s hit manga, penned by Hiroshi Seko, produced by MAPPA, and directed by Tatsuya Yoshihara, it’s the ultimate, action-fueled anime extravaganza.</p>
