<strong>What you should know before reading any of this:</strong></p>

<p>The plaform is "mobile first".<br>
Am 21year old male from Africa, Uganda , a self taught software engineer with 8 years of experience(since i started writing code)  in js, c/c++,python,bash scripting and Java.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong> <br>
I have been on vacation(high school vacation here lasts for about 12 months), and have built alot of side projects, read and written alot of code,plus doing whatever i wanted...<br>
Actual reason was actually curiosity.</p>

<p><strong>short story:</strong><br>
I have been working on it for about 2.5 months. Database is fully under supabase API. These are some of the features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Realtime messaging</li>
<li>Comment section</li>
<li>Inapp marketplace for selling games mainly HTML5 game using built with phaser3 and Android games built using libGDX personally made by me (am also working on startup game development company).</li>
<li>Gamelauncher</li>
<li>Searching users by name and including filters for location  and hobbies(predefined hobbies).</li>
<li>Posting content similar to whatsapp status(compression is done using ffmpeg github actions after the post has been uploaded, supports text based posts, video , image). Storage is under cloudinary free-tier.</li>
<li>Notifications.(not realtime but fetches when the current data is invalidated or page refocuses)</li>
<li>Marketplace . Can be used by local users via mobile money(mainly from my country) and international users via credit cards.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's more but these are the things endusers will actually notice.</p>

<p>I used react-bootstrap, fortawesome, and react for the front end. Everything todo with lists uses react-window including the texting area.  </p>

<p>I would like some tips on what i should improve.</p>

<p>For now am hosting using github pages(not allowed for this kind of stuff). </p>

<p>Am using supabase free-tier though  i plan to scale if actually the platform becomes popular. The idea was to a have a social platform with games because sometimes there's no one to chat to or simply we don't want to actually chat at the moment, why not play a game.<br>
I could use some tips to improve it.</p>
