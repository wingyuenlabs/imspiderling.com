  Hollow Knight: Silksong – Double Moss Mother Boss Fight
</h1>

<p>In Weavenest Atla’s rare Double Moss Mother showdown, each hit only costs a single health segment, so hug the far left or right edges and don’t be afraid to tank a hit while you build your silk and clear out the smaller adds.</p>

<p>Recommended loadout: Hunter Crest, Longpin throwable, Silkspear ability, plus Druid’s Eye, Warding Bell, Flea Brew, Compass and Magnetite Brooch. For more on Silksong, check out the IGN wiki.</p>
