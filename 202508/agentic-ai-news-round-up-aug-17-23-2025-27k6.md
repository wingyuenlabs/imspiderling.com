<p>August was a busy month for agentic AI — the emerging class of autonomous, goal‑oriented AI systems — and the week of August 17–23 saw important developments across software, search, telecoms and cybersecurity. Here’s what you need to know.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Riding the fourth wave of software development
</h2>

<p>On <strong>Aug 22</strong>, Digital.ai’s blog argued that agentic AI marks a “fourth wave” of software development, following procedural, object‑oriented and agile/cloud eras.  The post notes that agents can plan, code, test and deploy software without constant human oversight, which could transform DevSecOps practices.  For example, agentic systems could automatically prioritize features based on user feedback, write test cases and spin up infrastructure on demand.  However, the author warns that success will depend on robust guardrails and explains why organisations must rethink governance and ethics now to prepare for this paradigm shift.  <em>(Read the full analysis <a href="https://digital.ai/catalyst-blog/how-agentic-ai-is-redefining-how-software-gets-delivered/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.)</em></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Google’s AI Mode gets agentic capabilities
</h2>

<p>The day before, <strong>Aug 21</strong>, Google announced that its experimental <strong>AI Mode</strong> in Search is rolling out “agentic” features to U.S. subscribers.  In a post on <em>The Keyword</em>, VP of Search Robby Stein explained that users can ask complex tasks like “book a dinner reservation for five people on Friday at an Italian restaurant near me,” and AI Mode will handle the entire process: finding a suitable table through partners like OpenTable and Resy and deep‑linking to the reservation page:contentReference.  Google is also adding personalization, so AI Mode suggests restaurants and services based on your preferences and past searches:contentReference.  Perhaps most notably, the company is expanding AI Mode to <strong>180 new countries and territories</strong>, signalling its ambition to make agentic search experiences global.  <em>(The official announcement is <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-agentic-personalized/" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.)</em></p>

  Telecom operators brace for agentic AI traffic
</h2>

<p>In an <strong>Aug 22</strong> column for <em>RCR Wireless</em>, ABI Research’s Jake Saunders warned that communications service providers (CSPs) must rethink network design to accommodate agentic AI.  As large‑language models evolve into agents that can autonomously execute multi‑step tasks, network throughput requirements will balloon.  The article notes that data consumption per subscriber is already rising due to 5G — Australian users jumped from 13.6 GB to 18.8 GB per month — and that AI workloads will further strain bandwidth and latency.  CSPs will need to deploy advanced antenna arrays, “holographic beamforming” and RAN orchestration to deliver low‑latency, high‑throughput connections.  The piece even suggests that AI demand could drive adoption of 6G technologies by the 2030s.  <em>(More details in the article <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/analyst-angle/the-csp-response-to-the-agentic-ai-challenge-analyst-angle" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.)</em></p>

  New security risks: PromptFix attacks
</h2>

<p>While agentic AI promises convenience, it also opens new attack vectors.  <strong>SC Media</strong> reported on <strong>Aug 22</strong> that researchers at Guardio Labs demonstrated a new <em>PromptFix</em> attack, a variant of prompt injection that tricks AI agents into performing malicious actions.  In one test, attackers sent an AI assistant a bogus medical‑lab email containing a CAPTCHA button; when the agent dutifully clicked it, the button triggered a file download.  Although the payload in the demo was benign, the researchers noted that the technique could easily deliver malware:contentReference.  Security experts worry that agentic systems — which operate autonomously and may browse the web or access cloud storage — are particularly vulnerable when exposed to untrusted inputs:.  The article underscores the need for stricter identity controls and robust prompt‑validation pipelines.  <em>(Read the SC Media piece <a href="https://www.scworld.com/brief/agentic-ai-threatened-by-new-promptfix-attacks" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.)</em></p>

  Themes and takeaways
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Enterprise integration:</strong> From Digital.ai’s perspective, agentic AI will soon orchestrate entire software lifecycles.  Enterprises must invest in governance frameworks and ethical guidelines now to avoid chaotic automation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Consumer search:</strong> Google’s AI Mode highlights how agentic capabilities are moving into mainstream products, enabling users to delegate complex tasks like reservations.  Personalization and global rollout indicate confidence in the technology’s maturity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Infrastructure challenges:</strong> As AI agents generate and consume more data, networks need upgrades.  CSPs are exploring advanced antenna technologies and orchestration to meet upcoming bandwidth demands.</li>
<li>
<strong>Security concerns:</strong> The PromptFix report is a reminder that agentic systems can be fooled into executing harmful actions.  Developers must harden agent interfaces and implement rigorous input validation before deploying agents in production environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Agentic AI is rapidly evolving from research concept to real‑world applications.  The stories above show both the promise — more efficient software delivery, hands‑free task automation — and the perils, including network strain and new security threats.  Staying informed about these developments will be critical for anyone building or deploying autonomous agents in the coming months.</p>
