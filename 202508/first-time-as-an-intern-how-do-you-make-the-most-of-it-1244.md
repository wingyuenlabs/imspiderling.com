<p><strong>Hi Dev Community</strong> 👋</p>

<p>I just started my very first internship, and I’ll be here for about two months. The company’s platform is pretty big and complex, and honestly, I’m feeling a little overwhelmed 🤯 Since this is my first real-world experience, I don’t want to just “pass time”, I want to really make the most out of this opportunity, learn as much as possible, and contribute in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>For those of you who have been interns before (or mentored interns), I’d love to hear: </p>

<ul>
<li>How did you structure your learning during the internship?</li>
<li>What helped you balance between asking questions vs. figuring things out yourself?</li>
<li>What’s the best way to make an impact in such a short time?</li>
<li>Any common mistakes I should avoid?</li>
</ul>

<p>I really want to make this journey meaningful, so any tips, stories, or lessons learned from your own experience would be super super helpful 🙂</p>

<p>Thanks in advance 😊</p>
