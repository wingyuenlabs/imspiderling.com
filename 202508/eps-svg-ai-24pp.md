  Introduction
</h1>

<p>Recently, I’ve been handling vector files more often at work—especially <strong>EPS</strong> and <strong>SVG</strong>. As a personal memo, this post concisely summarizes the positioning, strengths, caveats, and best-use cases for the main extensions: <strong>EPS</strong> / <strong>SVG</strong> / <strong>AI</strong>.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)
</h1>

<p>📝 Overview</p>

<ul>
<li>Late 1980s (Adobe). A print-oriented vector format from the heyday of DTP.</li>
<li>Contents are PostScript programs (text), though some EPS files include binary elements (e.g., embedded previews).</li>
</ul>

<p>💪 Strengths</p>

<ul>
<li>Excellent for high-resolution printing; works well in PostScript-based output environments.</li>
<li>Can embed placed raster images.</li>
</ul>

<p>‼️ Cautions (practical pitfalls)</p>

<ul>
<li>Does not natively preserve transparency, so exporting EPS from Illustrator often <strong>flattens transparency</strong> (can cause visual discrepancies).</li>
<li>Not suitable for the web (heavy / no interactivity / not supported by browsers).</li>
<li>Today’s print workflows mainly use PDF (or PDF/X). EPS remains a legacy format that is still sometimes requested.</li>
</ul>

<p>🧰 When to use (minimally)</p>

<ul>
<li>When the client explicitly requests EPS and you know their workflow is PostScript-based.</li>
<li>Otherwise, default to PDF/X for safety.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
  
  
  SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
</h1>

<p>📝 Overview</p>

<ul>
<li>1999 (W3C standard). A web-standard vector format. XML-based.</li>
</ul>

<p>💪 Strengths</p>

<ul>
<li>Infinitely scalable without quality loss; lightweight and strong in browsers.</li>
<li>Supports styling and animation via CSS/JS; an excellent fit for interactive UIs.</li>
<li>Rich visual features (transparency, gradients, filters, etc.).</li>
<li>Can embed raster images (PNG/JPEG) as well (often discouraged depending on use case).</li>
</ul>

<p>‼️ Cautions (practical pitfalls)</p>

<ul>
<li>Support is limited in print workflows (depends on the RIP or submission guidelines).</li>
<li>Designed for browsers, so the default color space is RGB. Print-oriented needs like CMYK/spot colors are better handled by PDF-based workflows.</li>
<li>Fonts are environment-dependent; consider web-font loading or outlining.</li>
<li>Security: inline SVG can contain scripts, so sanitize files when exchanging them.</li>
</ul>

<p>🧰 When to use</p>

<ul>
<li>Browser-bound deliverables such as web logos, icons, illustrations, UI parts, and animations.</li>
<li>For print, export a final PDF instead.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
  
  
  AI (Adobe Illustrator format)
</h1>

<p>📝 Overview</p>

<ul>
<li>1987 (Adobe). Illustrator’s native <strong>editing</strong> (“mothership”) format.</li>
<li>Modern AI files are effectively <strong>“PDF-compatible data + Illustrator-specific data”</strong> (older generations could be EPS-compatible).</li>
</ul>

<p>💪 Strengths</p>

<ul>
<li>Preserves full editing info: layers, artboards, guides, appearances, etc.</li>
<li>Can export to many formats as needed: PDF / EPS / SVG / PNG.</li>
</ul>

<p>‼️ Cautions (practical pitfalls)</p>

<ul>
<li>Limited compatibility outside Illustrator; even if a file opens, layers/effects may be missing.</li>
<li>Version compatibility issues: older Illustrator versions may not open newer AI files.

<ul>
<li>Before sharing, enable “Create PDF Compatible File,” or save to an older version.</li>
</ul>


</li>

<li>For the web, it’s common to export to SVG/PNG for delivery.</li>

</ul>

<p>🧰 When to use</p>

<ul>
<li>As the <strong>working/editing master</strong>: intermediate assets, team sharing, archiving.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
  
  
  Which to use at a glance
</h1>

<ul>
<li>For production work: AI (preserves full editing info)
</li>
<li>For print deliverables: PDF (PDF/X recommended)
<em>Use EPS only when explicitly requested by the recipient</em>
</li>
<li>For web deliverables: SVG (with PNG/JPEG as needed)</li>
</ul>

<h1>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h1>

<p>I’ve understood the basics of vectors and used them in limited ways, but I wasn’t deeply familiar with the differences among the vector file extensions (EPS, SVG, AI). Since I’ve been handling EPS and SVG more frequently at work, I want to better understand their differences so I can choose the most appropriate format for each job.</p>

<p>This is a personal memo-style write-up, but I hope it’s helpful. Thanks for reading.</p>
