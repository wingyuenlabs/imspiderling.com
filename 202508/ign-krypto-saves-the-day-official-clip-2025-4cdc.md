<p><strong>Krypto Saves the Day!</strong>  </p>

<p>Krypto, fresh off his big-screen cameo in Superman, stars in a new four-part comedy-cartoons series from Warner Bros. Animation and DC Studios. From rescuing runaway school buses to battling candy capers on Halloween and saving cruise ships during Spring Break, our caped pup proves no mission is too small (or too sweet!).</p>

<p>The first episode, <strong>School Bus Shuffle</strong>, drops online August 13—just ahead of its inclusion as a bonus feature on the digital and physical releases of Superman. Three more adventures—<strong>Halloween Havoc</strong>, <strong>Package Pandemonium</strong>, and <strong>Coastal Catastrophe</strong>—will roll out one by one through 2026.</p>
