<p>Get ready for a new <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> game that's taking a big cue from the legendary roguelike, <em>FTL</em>. The upcoming title, <em>Scattered Hopes</em>, aims to deliver that same kind of intense, space-faring adventure.</p>

<p>The gameplay promises to be a rollercoaster, swinging from "white-knuckle" tension during Cylon attacks to surprisingly chill, quiet moments. It sounds like it won't just be non-stop combat, giving you some time to breathe between the chaos.</p>
