<p>Servus and welcome back to <strong>Day 40</strong> of my journey â€” today I continued <strong>working on the automations</strong>.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  ðŸ¤– Progress on Automations
</h2>

<p>I spent most of the day fine-tuning the workflows and testing edge cases.<br><br>
Itâ€™s going well, but I <strong>expect to need one more full day</strong> to get everything running smoothly.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  ðŸ›  Long Day, Big Focus
</h2>

<p>Today was another <strong>long workday</strong>, but it felt productive. The more I tweak the automations, the closer I get to a fully functional system.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  ðŸ”œ Next Steps
</h2>

<p>Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll continue:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finalizing the workflow logic
</li>
<li>Testing the triggers and actions
</li>
<li>Preparing for deployment</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking forward to crossing the finish line on this part of the project!</p>

<p>See you tomorrow,<br><br>
<strong>Jonathan (0xj0n1)</strong></p>
