<p>I recently set out to build a full-fledged SaaS website from the ground up – and it turned out to be surprisingly smooth once I picked the right tools. By layering AI-powered helpers with modern frameworks, I streamlined every step from coding to content. In this article I’ll share <em>everything</em> I used – from ForgeCode (an AI CLI coding assistant) to ChatGPT and beyond – to develop my site faster, smarter, and with fewer headaches. If you’re curious how these tools work together to supercharge a development project, read on!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  1. <a href="https://dub.sh/RUrRJ4i" rel="noopener noreferrer">ForgeCode (CLI-based AI coding agent)</a>
</h2>

<p>I started every day coding with <a href="https://dub.sh/aMDR2RL" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ForgeCode</strong></a> – a command-line AI pair programmer that lives in my terminal. It felt like having an expert teammate: I could ask it questions like “how do I add X feature” or “why is this code failing,” and it would dive into my codebase and give context-aware answers.  </p>

<p>As the Forge documentation notes, it <strong>“helps you code faster, solve complex problems, and learn new technologies without leaving your terminal.”</strong> For example, I literally asked ForgeCode to design a database schema for user accounts and posts. It responded by outlining tables, relationships, and indexes to use, effectively kickstarting my database design.  </p>

<p>ForgeCode also “works natively with your CLI, so you don’t need to switch IDEs” – meaning I could iterate code and get AI feedback without leaving the shell. In practice, this saved me hours on boilerplate code and debugging, since ForgeCode spotted issues and even suggested refactors on the fly.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  2. <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Copilot (AI pair programmer)</a>
</h2>

<p>In my IDE (VS Code), I leaned heavily on <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong>. It’s like autocomplete on steroids – as I typed, Copilot suggested entire functions, comments, and code snippets. It even offers a chat assistant inside the editor.  </p>

<p>Using Copilot felt like coding alongside a knowledgeable teammate who could handle routine parts of the code. Developers using Copilot report <em>up to 55% more productivity</em> when writing code. I experienced that first-hand: routine tasks like form validation or API calls were often fully or partly written by Copilot, letting me focus on the unique logic of my app.  </p>

<p>Overall, Copilot shaved away a lot of grunt work and helped me adhere to best practices by example.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  3. <a href="https://nextjs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a> and <a href="https://react.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a> (Frontend framework)
</h2>

<p>For the frontend I used <strong>React</strong> with <strong>Next.js</strong>, the go-to framework for modern web apps. Next.js made it easy to create fast, SEO-friendly pages and handle user auth with minimal setup. Experts call Next.js a <em>“leading framework for modern web applications, designed to boost performance and user engagement.”</em>  </p>

<p>I organized each page/component in React and let Next.js handle bundling, routing, and server-side rendering. For styling, I used <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, which let me build responsive, consistent UI by composing utility classes.  </p>

<p>This combo meant I could prototype pages quickly. When I wasn’t sure how to structure a page, I’d even ask ChatGPT or ForgeCode for suggestions on layout or React patterns. Together, Next.js/React and Tailwind helped me build a polished UI without wrestling with low-level HTML/CSS.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fi5s5642efc7mrjt2zsbh.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fi5s5642efc7mrjt2zsbh.gif" alt="sponge" width="500" height="295"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  4. UI/UX Design (<a href="https://www.figma.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figma</a> + AI)
</h2>

<p>Before coding the UI, I did wireframes and mockups in <strong>Figma</strong>. Figma’s design canvas (plus its AI plugins) was perfect for quickly iterating on layouts and color schemes.  </p>

<p>Sometimes I described my app’s style to ChatGPT or used an AI image generator like DALL·E for initial graphics or logos, then refined them in Figma. This fusion of design tools and AI brainstorming let me finalize the UI look in a fraction of the time it might normally take.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fpqef7i1krz6umi1rpxxr.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fpqef7i1krz6umi1rpxxr.gif" alt="wuhuu" width="480" height="270"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  5. Backend &amp; Database (<a href="https://supabase.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supabase</a> + <a href="https://www.prisma.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prisma</a>)
</h2>

<p>On the backend, I chose a serverless approach. I used <strong>Supabase</strong> for the database (PostgreSQL) and authentication, and <strong>Prisma</strong> as an ORM. This let me write backend code in Next.js API routes without provisioning servers.  </p>

<p>Every time I needed a new database table or field, I’d model it in Prisma and deploy migrations automatically. ForgeCode even helped here: I described my data model needs and it suggested a schema layout.  </p>

<p>Authentication (user signup/login) I handled with NextAuth, which integrates easily with Supabase.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5h42vmmvwaaccwdp5u8w.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F5h42vmmvwaaccwdp5u8w.gif" alt="awesome" width="480" height="270"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  6. Payments and Authentication (<a href="https://next-auth.js.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">NextAuth</a> + <a href="https://stripe.com/in" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a>)
</h2>

<p>For user management, I implemented <strong>NextAuth</strong> (an open-source auth library) so I didn’t have to code login flows by hand.  </p>

<p>For payments and subscriptions, I went with <strong>Stripe</strong>. I integrated Stripe’s API so I could charge monthly fees and handle credit cards securely. Stripe made this easy – after all, it’s <em>“the suite of APIs powering online payment processing and commerce”</em> for many businesses.  </p>

<p>Millions of companies <em>“use Stripe to accept payments online and in person.”</em> Knowing Stripe is battle-tested gave me confidence, and its documentation plus example code meant I could get subscriptions up within a day.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F01yh0cdm43gi0wxceiwe.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F01yh0cdm43gi0wxceiwe.gif" alt="hehe" width="360" height="202"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  7. Hosting &amp; Deployment (<a href="https://vercel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel</a>)
</h2>

<p>Once the site was ready, I deployed it on <strong>Vercel</strong> – a cloud platform made by the creators of Next.js.  </p>

<p>Vercel’s one-click deployment from GitHub meant every time I pushed to the main branch, my site was automatically built and published (SSL, CDN, caching included). Serverless functions scaled automatically too.  </p>

<p>This meant I didn’t worry about devops; I could focus on code and let Vercel handle uptime and global delivery.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0igwbaabbqhwq7cetccg.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F0igwbaabbqhwq7cetccg.gif" alt="hmm" width="480" height="270"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  8. Code Management &amp; CI/CD (<a href="https://github.com/features/actions" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions</a>)
</h2>

<p>I kept all my code in <strong>GitHub</strong>, using branches and pull requests for any new feature. For continuous integration, I configured <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to run tests and linting on every push, and to redeploy to Vercel on merge to main.  </p>

<p>This automated workflow was a lifesaver – it caught typos, formatting issues, or failing tests before anything hit production. Managing the project in GitHub also let me use issue tracking and project boards to stay organized.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fco3e5cgk9szd60ip6jx4.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fco3e5cgk9szd60ip6jx4.gif" alt="yuhu" width="480" height="376"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  9. Content Writing &amp; SEO (<a href="https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a> + <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammarly</a>)
</h2>

<p>I couldn’t neglect the marketing side: my site needed good copy and SEO-friendly content. For writing landing pages, blog posts, and even email templates, I turned to <strong>ChatGPT</strong>.  </p>

<p>I’d give it bullet points or a brief and it would output polished paragraphs, which I then edited. After generating drafts, I ran everything through <strong>Grammarly</strong> to catch any grammar or clarity issues.  </p>

<p>This two-step AI approach saved me tons of time. What might have taken hours of brainstorming and editing was done in minutes.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxltivum0ua3ca7gl16yj.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fxltivum0ua3ca7gl16yj.gif" alt="awesome" width="480" height="273"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  10. Analytics &amp; Monitoring (<a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a> + <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry</a>)
</h2>

<p>Finally, I added some tools to measure and maintain the site. I set up <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to track user signups, page views, and funnel conversions.  </p>

<p>For error tracking, I integrated <strong>Sentry</strong> so I’d get notified if any client or server exception happened. When I saw a weird error, I sometimes pasted the stack trace into ChatGPT to brainstorm causes – it’s uncanny how it can suggest debugging steps from an error message.  </p>

<p>Together, analytics and monitoring closed the loop: I could see user behavior data, iterate on the site, and catch bugs quickly.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjynj4j43t4cleerzwixn.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjynj4j43t4cleerzwixn.gif" alt="watchu" width="480" height="270"></a></p>
