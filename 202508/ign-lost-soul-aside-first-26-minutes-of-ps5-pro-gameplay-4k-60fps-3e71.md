<p><strong>Lost Soul Aside: First 26 Minutes of PS5 Pro Gameplay</strong><br><br>
Kick things off in Performance Pro Mode as you meet Kaser, Louisa, Zana and the rest of the crew plotting to light up the city with fireworks. You’ll breeze through some light platforming and soak in the game’s vibrant world before all hell breaks loose.</p>

<p>Then it’s pure over-the-top combat—flashy combos, epic summons and boss showdowns galore. If you just want the fight scenes, hop to the YouTube chapters (Combat 1 at 1:08, Combat 5 at 21:05) and get ready to mash those buttons.</p>
