<p>At gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live, Relic Entertainment dropped the first trailer for Dawn of War 4, narrated by Blood Ravens Captain Cyrus. Set on the war-ravaged planet Kronus in 2026 (PC), it teases epic RTS battles, classic base-building, massive armies and a brand-new narrative 200 years after Dark Crusade.</p>

<p>You’ll command four iconic factions—Space Marines (Blood Ravens), Orks, Adeptus Mechanicus and Necrons—alongside familiar faces like Jonah and Gorgutz. Expect all the deep strategy and modern polish that made the series legendary.</p>
