<h2>
  
  
  TL;DR
</h2>

<p>Every day we use different technological tools, already on automatism, although we have not heard about them before. </p>

<p>With the knowledge of the new, we gain that competitiveness in the market that will provide us with what we want, be it an online store or a simple calculator.</p>

<p>In this article, I have collected some tools, knowledge of which will help you become the ultimate developer.</p>

<p>Let's get started! 🏎️</p>




<h2>
  
  
  1. 🐜 <a href="https://hmpl-lang.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMPL.js</a> - Server-oriented customizable templating for JavaScript
</h2>

<p>Let's start with a small template language that allows you to get components from the server and display them on the client. Due to its syntax, applications are quite small.</p>

<p>It’s integrated with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json5" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON5</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOMPurify</a>, and keeps your JS bundles small. If you care about performance and like having full control, this one's worth a look.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  2. 🐈‍⬛ <a href="https://nestjs.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nest.js</a> - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and enterprise-grade server-side applications
</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever wished Express had a bit more structure, Nest.js is the upgrade you’ve been looking for. It brings TypeScript, OOP, and a modular architecture to Node.js development.</p>

<p>Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).</p>

<h2>
  
  
  3. 🧠 <a href="https://agent-tars.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agent TARS</a> - The Open-sourced Multimodal AI Agent Stack connecting Cutting-edge AI Models and Agent Infra.
</h2>

<p>None of my lists are complete without AI projects and this time will be no exception. Especially when it comes to ByteDance and its new product. With this tool, you can implement a convenient UI for AI agents either in a browser or in a terminal.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>agent-tars --provider openai --model gpt-4o --apiKey {apiKey}
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Agent TARS is a general multimodal AI Agent stack, it brings the power of GUI Agent and Vision into your terminal, computer, browser and product.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  4. 🐇 <a href="https://bun.sh" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bun</a> - Incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, test runner, and package manager – all in one
</h2>

<p>If you think that Node.js is slow today, then yes, you are right. I once said about Deno that it is one of the fastest environments, but probably Bun is the fastest today or was at least a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>Bun is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It ships as a single executable called <code>bun</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdra6wdi0xm63k1yqllfw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fdra6wdi0xm63k1yqllfw.png" alt="Gem 4" width="800" height="388"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  5. 🕷 <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supertest</a> - Super-agent driven library for testing node.js HTTP servers using a fluent API
</h2>

<p>Yes, a bit old, of course, but no less relevant module for testing http. Usually, other, more recent solutions are used, but this module is also valid even in 2025. Example of use:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>const request = require('supertest');
request(app)
  .get('/user')
  .expect('Content-Type', /json/);
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>The motivation with this module is to provide a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by superagent.</p>

  9. 🔗 <a href="https://www.langchain.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">LangChain</a> - Build context-aware reasoning applications
