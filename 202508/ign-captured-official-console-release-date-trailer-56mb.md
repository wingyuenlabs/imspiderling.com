<p>Captured drops you in an endless, ever-shifting hallway inside your own home, armed only with a camera and a sharp memory. Your mission? Spot and tag anomalies—strange lighting, missing rooms, odd objects or water—before the darkness closes in and you become the hunted.</p>

<p>Already live on PC, Captured arrives on PlayStation 5 on September 12, 2025, and on Xbox Series X/S on October 7, 2025. Think you’ve got the nerve (and the focus) to break the cycle?</p>
