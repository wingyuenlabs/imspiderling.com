<p>In a wild collaboration, the 3D Printing Nerd teamed up with Tynan from Linus Tech Tips to create a <em>massive</em>, transparent version of the famous LTT screwdriver. This wasn't your average desktop print job, either.</p>

<p>They used a huge Formlabs Form 4L resin printer to bring the giant, clear tool to life. Once it was finished, they took the epic creation on the road to show it off at the opensaucelive event.</p>
