<li><p>The latest “Designing Amon” video pulls back the curtain on how the Borderlands 4 team built their biggest Vault Hunter yet—from concept sketches and performance capture to final in-game model. Plus, mark your calendars: Borderlands 4 drops on PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 12, 2025, and on Nintendo Switch 2 on October 3, 2025.</p></li>
<li><p>Amon’s origin? He grew up worshipping Vault monsters—until one turned on his cult and he was the only survivor. Now he’s a monster-slaying warrior-poet: tough as nails but always ready with a war story or sage advice for his fellow Vault Hunters.</p></li>
