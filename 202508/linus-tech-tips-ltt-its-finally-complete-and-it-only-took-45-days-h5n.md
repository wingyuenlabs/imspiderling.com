<p>After a grueling 45-day saga, Linus and Elijah finally wrangled a PC build into the <em>Murder Box</em>, an ultra-rare case limited to just 250 units. The project was an absolute beast, centered around a custom hardline water-cooling loop that fought them every step of the way.</p>

<p>From parts not fitting to endless debates over fans and radiators, the build was a masterclass in problem-solving. They wrestled with complex tube bends and tricky wiring, all in an effort to create a clean-looking system without, in their words, making it look like "poopoo." In the end, they pulled it off and completed the monster build.</p>
