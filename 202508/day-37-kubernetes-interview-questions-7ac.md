<p>On Day 37, we look at Kubernetes Important Interview Questions &amp; Answers as it‚Äôs standard practice through out this challenge. <br>
We are going to look at a number of questions and provide answers for them regarding Kubernetes. </p>

<p>Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, powering cloud-native applications across industries. If you‚Äôre preparing for a DevOps interview, Kubernetes is almost guaranteed to show up. </p>

<p>Here are 16 important Kubernetes interview questions with concise answers.</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Kubernetes and why is it important?</p>

<p>Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, networking, and management of applications. It‚Äôs important because it ensures high availability, scalability, and self-healing for modern apps.</p>

<p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes?<br>
    ‚Ä¢ Docker Swarm ‚Üí Simple, lightweight, tightly integrated with Docker.<br>
    ‚Ä¢ Kubernetes ‚Üí Feature-rich, advanced scaling, rolling updates, self-healing, and works across cloud providers.</p>

<p>3Ô∏è‚É£ How does Kubernetes handle network communication between containers?</p>

<p>Each pod gets a unique IP. Kubernetes uses a flat network model, allowing pods to communicate directly. For external traffic, Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, Ingress) are used.</p>

<p>4Ô∏è‚É£ How does Kubernetes handle scaling of applications?</p>

<p>Using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Kubernetes monitors metrics like CPU/Memory and adjusts pod counts automatically.</p>

<p>5Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Deployment and how does it differ from a ReplicaSet?<br>
    ‚Ä¢ ReplicaSet ‚Üí Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running.<br>
    ‚Ä¢ Deployment ‚Üí Manages ReplicaSets and allows rolling updates &amp; rollbacks.</p>

<p>6Ô∏è‚É£ What are Rolling Updates in Kubernetes?</p>

<p>Rolling updates replace old pods with new ones gradually, ensuring zero downtime.</p>

<p>7Ô∏è‚É£ How does Kubernetes handle network security and access control?</p>

<p>Using Network Policies (control pod-to-pod traffic) and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for user permissions.</p>

<p>8Ô∏è‚É£ Example of a highly available application in Kubernetes?</p>

<p>Running a multi-replica web app behind a LoadBalancer/Ingress, spread across multiple nodes. If one pod or node fails, traffic is routed to healthy pods.</p>

<p>9Ô∏è‚É£ What is a Namespace in Kubernetes? Which one is default?</p>

<p>Namespaces logically isolate resources. If not specified, pods are created in the default namespace.</p>

<p>üîü How does Ingress help in Kubernetes?</p>

<p>Ingress manages external HTTP/HTTPS access to services, provides load balancing, SSL termination, and routing rules.</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Services in Kubernetes:<br>
    ‚Ä¢ ClusterIP ‚Äì Default, internal access.<br>
    ‚Ä¢ NodePort ‚Äì Exposes service via :.<br>
    ‚Ä¢ LoadBalancer ‚Äì Exposes externally using cloud provider‚Äôs LB.<br>
    ‚Ä¢ ExternalName ‚Äì Maps service to an external DNS name.</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Self-healing in Kubernetes?</p>

<p>Kubernetes restarts failed containers, reschedules pods on healthy nodes, and replaces them when deleted. Example: If a pod crashes, Deployment automatically recreates it.</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ How does Kubernetes handle storage management?</p>

<p>Through Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), allowing containers to use storage independent of the pod lifecycle.</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ How does NodePort service work?</p>

<p>NodePort exposes a service on every node‚Äôs IP at a static port. External traffic can access the service using :.</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Single-node vs Multi-node cluster?<br>
    ‚Ä¢ Single-node: Control plane + worker components run on one machine (good for testing).<br>
    ‚Ä¢ Multi-node: Control plane is separate, workloads distributed across worker nodes (production-ready).</p>

<p>1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Difference between kubectl create and kubectl apply?<br>
    ‚Ä¢ create ‚Üí Creates new resources; fails if already exists.<br>
    ‚Ä¢ apply ‚Üí Declarative approach; updates existing resources or creates if not present.</p>

<p>These questions cover the core concepts of Kubernetes and will prepare you for real-world DevOps interviews.</p>

<p>Pro tip: Don‚Äôt just memorize‚Äîpractice these concepts by actually deploying and scaling apps on a Kubernetetes</p>
