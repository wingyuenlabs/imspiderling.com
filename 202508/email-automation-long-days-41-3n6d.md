<p>Servus and welcome to <strong>Day 40</strong> of my journey — today I managed to build the first <strong>email automation</strong> for the project.  </p>




<h2>
  
  
  📧 Email Automation Done
</h2>

<p>The automation is up and running!<br><br>
It feels good to see the system slowly coming together piece by piece.  </p>




<h2>
  
  
  😮‍💨 The Grind Is Real
</h2>

<p>That’s all I could finish today.<br><br>
I’ve been working <strong>11 hours straight for the third day in a row</strong>, and on top of that, the <strong>heat</strong> makes it even tougher to stay fully focused.  </p>

<p>Still, every bit of progress counts. 🚀  </p>




<h2>
  
  
  🔜 What’s Next
</h2>

<p>Tomorrow I’ll continue improving the automations and hopefully wrap up this part of the setup.  </p>

<p>See you tomorrow,<br><br>
