<p><em>Let's talk about the resume.</em></p>

<p>You've seen a million of them. I've sent a million of them. It usually starts with a document that looks something like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F82lpy007kwx08okmsh5t.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F82lpy007kwx08okmsh5t.jpg" alt=" " width="650" height="920"></a></p>

<p>A beautiful piece of paper, right? ðŸ“œ It's packed with keywords, meticulously formatted, and tells you one thing with absolute certainty: I know how to use Google Docs.</p>

<p>But then comes the real fun... the ancient ritual of "The Interview."</p>

<p>It's a heroic journey. Our brave candidate, Sir Stickman, battles mythical beasts on his noble quest for employment.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2dhsjtikv5501qqoi88p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F2dhsjtikv5501qqoi88p.png" alt=" " width="800" height="800"></a></p>

<p>You know the story. He fights the Dragon of Unforeseen Traffic ðŸš—ðŸ’¥, narrowly dodges the Meteor of Spilled Coffee â˜•, and vanquishes the Goblin of Crippling Self-Doubt. All of this, just to sit in a chair and try to convince you he's the perfect fit based on a 30-minute conversation.</p>

<p>It's... a bit broken, isn't it?</p>

<p>This is me. Right here.</p>

<p><a href="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa6nqdv7jf3957q7asw5r.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fa6nqdv7jf3957q7asw5r.png" alt=" " width="800" height="1030"></a></p>

<p>This is my natural habitat. This is where I'm not fighting traffic; I'm building solutions. I'm not trying to remember the "5 greatest weaknesses" I rehearsed; I'm solving actual problems. This is what I love to do.</p>

<p>So I asked myself: Why am I trying to tell you I'm a skilled AI/Prompt Engineer on a piece of paper, when I can just show you?</p>

<p>I decided to do the resume thing my own way.</p>

<p>I built a resume that is the skill demonstration. A resume designed for the people I want to work with. A resume that proves my prowess before you even read the first line.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... my resume.</p>

<p>Game over. Mic drop. ðŸŽ¤</p>

<p>If you're looking for someone who fits neatly into a Word template, I might not be your guy.</p>

<p>But if you're looking for someone who sees a broken process and builds a better one... let's talk.</p>
