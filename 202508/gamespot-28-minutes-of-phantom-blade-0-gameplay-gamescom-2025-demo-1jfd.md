<p><strong>Phantom Blade 0’s Gamescom 2025 demo</strong> serves up a hefty 28-minute slice of slick combat and exploration, letting you tear through levels with the White Serpent and Crimson Viper blades, Seamless Death, Ink Cut, and the Night Owl bow. Midway, you swap to the Juggernaut and Soft Snake Sword, then unlock the cheeky Bashpole after taking down your first boss.</p>

<p>Boss runs steal the show at 13:32 with Wan Jun “Coppermaul” and again at 23:17 against the Chief Disciple of Seven Stars, sandwiched between free-roaming combat and hidden nooks waiting to be discovered.</p>
