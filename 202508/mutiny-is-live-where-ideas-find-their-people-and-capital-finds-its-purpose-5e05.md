<p>After months of building in stealth, we're finally ready to open the doors.</p>

<p><strong>Registration is now live at: <a href="https://mutiny-land.vercel.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://mutiny-land.vercel.app/</a></strong></p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Problem We're Solving
</h2>

<p>Every founder faces the same challenge: having a vision but needing the right people to make it real. The current landscape is fragmented - you've got networking events, accelerators, job boards, and investor platforms, but nothing that truly aligns ideas with the people who can execute them.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Meet Mut and Iny: Your AI Co-Pilots
</h2>

<p>At Mutiny's core are two complementary AIs designed to guide founders through the entire journey:</p>

<p><strong>Mut</strong> — The critical investor who stress-tests ideas for real viability. Think of Mut as your skeptical partner who asks the hard questions before anyone else does.</p>

<p><strong>Iny</strong> — The empathetic CEO who champions people, purpose, and solutions. Iny focuses on the human elements that make ideas worth pursuing.</p>

<p>Together, they help you find co-founders, team members, investors, and advisors who don't just have the right skills - they share your convictions.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Key Features
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  Idea Alignment Lab

<p>Signal your focus areas - from climate hardware to neurotech to creator infrastructure - and get matched with aligned collaborators, stealth startups, or investors who actually understand what you're building.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Transparent, Milestone-Based Funding
</h3>

<p>Community-backed capital is held in escrow and released only when goals are met. Every spend is visible. No more black box funding decisions.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Who This Is For
</h2>

<p>Whether you're:</p>

<ul>
<li>A founder refining an idea</li>
<li>An investor seeking conviction-driven projects</li>
<li>A builder looking for your place in the ecosystem</li>
</ul>

<p>Mutiny is designed to connect the right people at the right time with the right level of transparency and trust.</p>
