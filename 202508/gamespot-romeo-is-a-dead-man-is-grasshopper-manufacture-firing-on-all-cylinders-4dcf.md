<p>Suda 51 and his studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, are back with a wild new action game called <em>Romeo Is A Deadman</em>. It's a totally new IP, and it sounds like the developer is in top form, going all-out with their signature weirdness.</p>

<p>A hands-on preview revealed players will be fighting zombies, monsters, and even a <em>giant naked headless woman</em>. The early buzz is super positive, suggesting this is a chaotic and awesome return to form for the cult-favorite studio.</p>
