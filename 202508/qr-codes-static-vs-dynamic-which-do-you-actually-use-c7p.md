<p>Lately Iâ€™ve been diving deep into the world of QR codes (yes, I know, not the sexiest tech topic ðŸ˜…).</p>

<p>One thing Iâ€™ve noticed: a lot of services make it really confusing. You generate a QR, then months later you find out itâ€™s expired, locked behind a paywall, or youâ€™ve lost control of the redirect.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m curious: for your projects or businesses, do you prefer static QR codes (permanent, free, unchangeable) or dynamic ones (redirectable, but usually managed by a service)?</p>

<p>Personally, Iâ€™ve been working on a little side project, <a href="https://hrefs.eu" class="ltag_cta ltag_cta--branded" rel="noopener noreferrer">hrefs.eu</a>
, that lets you do both:</p>

<p>Static codes: free forever, never expire</p>

<p>Dynamic codes: you control the redirect, no lock-ins</p>

<p>But Iâ€™d love to hear from this community:</p>

<p>Do you even use QR codes in your projects?</p>

<p>If yes, which type do you find more useful?</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s your biggest pain point with them?</p>

<p>Letâ€™s discuss! I think thereâ€™s more nuance to QR codes than people give them credit for.</p>
