<p><strong>Primitive War</strong> crashes into theaters on August 21, 2025, courtesy of Fathom Entertainment and Rialto Distribution. Directed by Luke Sparke and based on Ethan Pettus’s novel, this action‐packed thrill ride follows the Vulture Squad on a mission deep in the jungle—and, trust me, it’s anything but a picnic.</p>

<p>Set in Vietnam, 1968, this recon unit is sent to find a missing Green Beret platoon—and quickly learns they’re not alone. Think battle-hardened soldiers facing off against prehistoric predators in the ultimate fight for survival.</p>
