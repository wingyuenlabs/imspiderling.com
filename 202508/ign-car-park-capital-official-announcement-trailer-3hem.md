<p><strong>Car Park Capital</strong> drags you into Big Auto’s iron grip, turning sleepy towns into sprawling seas of asphalt—one parking lot at a time. This satirical tycoon sim has you laying down concrete cathedrals, bulldozing homes and pumping propaganda to convince folks that life’s just better when you’re elbow-to-fender in your car.</p>

<p>Mix real-time strategy, urban-planning tools and tongue-in-cheek humor as you pave the road to a shinier, oilier future. Coming soon to PC—because what’s a sim without a little exhaust?</p>
