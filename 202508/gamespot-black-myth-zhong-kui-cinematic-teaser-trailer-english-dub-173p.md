<p><strong>Black Myth: Zhong Kui â€“ Cinematic Teaser Trailer (English Dub)</strong><br><br>
Game Science has officially unveiled the second entry in their Black Myth series with a stunning CG teaser trailer at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2025. This single-player action RPG draws on the legendary Chinese folk hero Zhong Kui, promising epic swordplay, supernatural foes and a moral journey straight out of myth.</p>

<p>Though still in early development (so no gameplay footage just yet), the teaser sets a dark, poetic tone: immortal judges tangled in human ties, ghosts born of the heart, and a lone hero raising his blade to mete out justice. Fans of folklore-inspired fantasy should keep this one on their radar!</p>
