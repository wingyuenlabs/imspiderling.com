<p>In this teaser, a narrator expresses a heartfelt longing to meet someone special in a charming little town—darting around street corners, hiding on shelves for a secret peek, weaving between passersby, and swishing a tail to the music—all set against lazy waves lapping at the shore and a ticking clock that marks the passage from dawn to dusk.</p>

<p>As anticipation builds, the promise of reunion shines bright: once they finally turn around and meet each other’s gaze, sundered bonds will be renewed, and all eighty-one Planes will come together in a dazzling harmony.</p>
