<p>Excel is powerful, but let’s be honest, it can also be a time sink.<br>
If you’re still manually cleaning data, writing long formulas, or formatting reports, you’re wasting hours every week.</p>

<p>The good news?<br>
You can use ChatGPT to automate most of it, without being an Excel wizard or writing complicated VBA from scratch.</p>

<p>These are 10 Excel tasks I’ve helped professionals automate, both in my consulting work and in my bestselling book ChatGPT Prompts for Excel.</p>
