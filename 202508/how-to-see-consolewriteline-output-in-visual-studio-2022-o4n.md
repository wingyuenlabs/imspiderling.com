  How to See Console.WriteLine Output in Visual Studio 2022
</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re new to Visual Studio or just getting started with C#, itâ€™s common to be confused when <strong>Console.WriteLine()</strong> doesnâ€™t seem to show anything. Donâ€™t worry â€” the output is thereâ€¦ you just need to know where to look.</p>

<p>In this post, weâ€™ll walk through exactly how to view <strong>Console.WriteLine()</strong> output in Visual Studio 2022, and how to avoid the common pitfalls that hide the console window.</p>

<p><strong>âœ… Step 1 â€” Make Sure You Are Using a Console Application</strong></p>

<p><strong>Console.WriteLine()</strong> only works in a Console Application. If you accidentally created a Windows Forms or WPF project, the output will not appear in a console window.</p>

<p><strong>How to check:</strong></p>

<p>Open your project in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>In Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select Properties.</p>

<p>Under Output Type, make sure Console Application is selected.</p>

<p>If itâ€™s anything else (like Windows Application), change it to Console Application and rebuild.</p>

<p><strong>âœ… Step 2 â€” Run the Application (with Ctrl + F5)</strong></p>

<p>To actually see the output, you need to run the app. There are two ways to do it:</p>

<div class="table-wrapper-paragraph"><table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Action</th>
<th>Shortcut</th>
<th>Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Start with debugging</td>
<td>F5</td>
<td>Runs the app and immediately closes the window when it finishes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Start <strong>without</strong> debugging</td>
<td><strong>Ctrl + F5</strong></td>
<td>Runs the app and keeps the console window <strong>open</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>

<p>Most beginners use F5 and wonder why the console flashes and disappears.<br>
Always use Ctrl + F5 if you want the console window to remain open after it finishes executing.</p>

<p><strong>âœ… Step 3 â€” Check the Output Window (Optional)</strong><br>
If the program starts and closes immediately, or if youâ€™re using F5, you can still check the Output window in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>To open it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>View â†’ Output<br>
or press Ctrl + Alt + O</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scroll to the bottom â€” Visual Studio logs the console application output there as well.</p>

<p>ðŸ’¡ <strong>Bonus Tip</strong> â€” Add <strong>Console.ReadKey()</strong> or <strong>Console.ReadLine()</strong> at the End</p>

<p>To force the console window to wait for user input, add this line at the end of your Main method:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Console.ReadKey();</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Console.ReadLine();</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That way, the console stays open until you press a key.</p>

<p>ðŸ”§ <strong>Example</strong></p>

<p><strong>âœ… Quick Summary</strong></p>

<p><strong>Console.WriteLine()</strong> works only in a Console Application.</p>

<p>Use Ctrl + F5 to start the app without debugging, and keep the console open.</p>

<p>Alternatively, add Console.ReadKey() at the end of your Main method.</p>

<p>You can also check View â†’ Output in Visual Studio to see the output.</p>
