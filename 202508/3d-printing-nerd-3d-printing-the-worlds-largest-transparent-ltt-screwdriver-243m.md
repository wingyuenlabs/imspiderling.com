<p>In an epic team-up, 3D printing pros collaborated with Tynan from Linus Tech Tips to create the <em>world's largest</em> transparent LTT screwdriver. The massive, crystal-clear tool was brought to life using a Formlabs resin 3D printer.</p>

<p>After pulling off the impressive print, they didn't just keep it on a shelf â€” they took the giant screwdriver on the road to show it off at the Open Sauce Live event.</p>
