<p>Robin Hood gallops back in a fresh, 10-episode MGM+ drama reimagining the classic outlaw tale. Jack Patten headlines as Rob, a Saxon forester’s son, opposite Lauren McQueen’s daring Marian, with Sean Bean hissing his way through Nottingham as the Sheriff. The series kicks off with a special two-episode premiere on Sunday, November 2 at 9:00 PM ET/PT and then drops weekly until the grand finale on December 28.</p>

<p>Set after the Norman invasion, this Robin-and-Marian love story doubles as a fierce fight against royal corruption—Rob leading a rebel band in the forest while Marian works her magic at court. Executive produced by John Glenn, Jonathan English and Todd Lieberman, the show will stream not only in the U.S. but across the U.K., Europe, Latin America and beyond.</p>
