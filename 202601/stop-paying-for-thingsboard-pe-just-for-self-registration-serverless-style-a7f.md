<p>Self-registration is locked behind the Professional Edition paywall, and manual onboarding in the Community Edition (CE) is a major pain for makers scaling their projects. I built a Serverless Unclocker to bypass this using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.</p>

<p><strong>Why use it?</strong><br>
Zero Cost: Stays within the AWS Free Tier, avoiding expensive licenses.<br>
Automated: No more manual user creation or dashboard assignment.<br>
Secure: Handles public onboarding without exposing your ThingsBoard root credentials.<br>
If you are tired of "resource scarcity" and manual tasks in IoT, this bridge is for you.</p>

<p>What other CE features should I "unlock" next?</p>

<p>I love Thingsboard ⭐️</p>
