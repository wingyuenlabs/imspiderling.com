<p>Most AI safety discussions focus on what systems should do.</p>

<p>This work focuses on when nothing should happen.</p>

<p>We published an institutional, non-normative audit of a 27-document cognitive framework (CP27) built around one invariant:</p>

<p>STOP must be a valid output.</p>

<p>The framework enforces:</p>

<ul>
<li>decision boundaries placed as early as possible,</li>
<li>strict human-only decision authority,</li>
<li>AI limited to measurement, verification, and traceability,</li>
<li>explicit STOP / SILENCE fail-safe mechanisms,</li>
<li>hard separation between narrative, methodology, and governance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The logic is similar to edge security:<br>
don’t react more — decide sooner, before complexity, cost, or risk accumulate.</p>

<p>No certification claims.<br>
No normative authority.<br>
Fully auditable, falsifiable, and institution-ready by design.</p>

<p>Audit + encapsulation (Zenodo):<br>

<p>Interested in discussing structure and invariants — not beliefs.</p>
