<p>Tired of switching between Wiki and YouTube to learn something? I built PLI 7.9 to create a '3+1' learning dashboard. One search gives you the best 3 text deep-dives and the top video guide in one unified screen.</p>

<p>Multimodal: Combines text, video, and image context instantly.</p>

<p>Fast: Sub-second response times via Vercel and smart API pooling.</p>

<p>Clean: Built for researchers, students, and devs who hate ads.</p>
