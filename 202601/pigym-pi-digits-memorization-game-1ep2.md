<p>It's a vibe coded slop and I have not written a single line of code for this project, but I still think it's pretty impressive what the current LLM models can churn out. I used Claude Opus 4.5 for everything. The point is, I described pretty much all the features that I had in mind and it managed to implement them more or less correctly, in some instances, even surpassing my expectations. I am looking for ideas and suggestion on what could be improved and features people would like to see.</p>
