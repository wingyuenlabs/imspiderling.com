<p>Since users are sometimes considered the weakest link in an organization's security, cybersecurity education will go a long way to ensure that they become one of your best defenses.</p>

<p>Welcome to this week's security review.</p>

</h2>

<p>Here is something that we all can learn from this article: when you search online, be very careful of the links that you click. Also, you should download your software from legitimate online sources </p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the latest set of attacks, users searching for Notepad++ are served links to a convincing phishing site masquerading as associated with the software program ("cn-notepadplusplus[.]com"). Other domains registered by Black Cat include "cn-obsidian[.]com," "cn-winscp[.]com," and "notepadplusplus[.]cn."</p>

</h2>

<p>It's a bad thing to reuse usernames and passwords across multiple online accounts. If you're guilty of this, change now!</p>

<p>A quick lesson from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...credential stuffing is the digital equivalent of someone discovering a skeleton key that opens your house, office, and safe – all in one sweep. And finding that key needn't be difficult at all – it can be gathered from past data breaches and cybercrime markets or attackers can deploy so-called infostealer malware that siphons credentials off compromised devices and web browsers.</p>

</h2>

<p>If your organization is deploying AI assistants and agents, ensure that you read articles like this. And if you're wondering if it's a prompt injection attack, know that you're right.</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fairness, OpenAI is hardly alone in this unending cycle of mitigating an attack only to see it revived through a simple change. If the past five years are any guide, this pattern is likely to endure indefinitely, in much the way SQL injection and memory corruption vulnerabilities continue to provide hackers with the fuel they need to compromise software and websites.</p>
