<p>After 8 years in IT Operations, I made a conscious decision: I’m not just going to "learn" Cloud Security. I’m going to live it.</p>

<p>I am currently in the middle of a full career pivot. My days are spent on foundational IT retraining, my nights are dedicated to AWS certifications and Cloud Security. But certificates are just paper if you don't apply them.</p>

<p>I promised myself that I wouldn't use this time to just "park" and wait for a degree. I am building a "launchpad".</p>

<p><strong>The Project: Building a Home for Cloud Architects</strong></p>

<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to support <strong>Marko Sluga</strong> a true authority in the AWS world and someone I’ve looked up to for learning cloud architecture. His community needed a new home, a place to discuss complex AWS topics, share knowledge, and grow together.</p>

<p>I volunteered to design and build the infrastructure for his new <strong>Discord Community.</strong></p>

<p>This wasn't just about creating channels. It was about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Designing a logical structure for discussions</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing security best practices for community management</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a space where knowledge can scale</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When It clicked</strong> for me: Validation over Certification</p>

<p>We often obsess over passing exams (and I am grinding for them too!). But in the real world, soft skills and mindset often beat raw data retention.</p>

<p>After the launch, Marko gave me feedback that hit harder than any "Exam Passed" badge ever could:</p>

<p>"Ali Funk being willing to take ownership like you did is a rare trait and I am grateful for your help. You deserve every ounce of recognition!" <br>
Marko Sluga</p>

<p>He didn't thank me for "configuring a bot." He thanked me for <strong>taking ownership.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why I aim to be an AWS Community Builder</strong></p>

<p>This experience clarified my path. I realized that my biggest strength isn't just configuring systems</p>

<p>It´s <strong>enabling others.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I love bridging the gap between "Old School Ops" reliability and "Cloud Native" agility</p></li>
<li><p>I love building infrastructures where communities can thrive</p></li>
<li><p>I love the "hybrid war" of learning and doing simultaneously</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is why I have set my sights on becoming an <strong>AWS Community Builder.</strong></p>

<p>I want to be part of the global group of people who don't just consume cloud technology, but who actively shape how it is understood and used. <br>
I want to share my journey from the Data Center floor to the cloud architecture board, helping others who are making the same pivot.</p>

<p><strong>The Takeaway</strong></p>

<p>If you are early in your cloud journey, or pivoting like me: Don't wait for permission. Don't wait until you have 5 certs to build something. Find a problem. Fix it. Take ownership.</p>

<p>That’s how you build a "launchpad"<br>
