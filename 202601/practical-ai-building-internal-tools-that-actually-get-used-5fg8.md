<p>AI is everywhere right now—but most teams aren’t struggling with a lack of AI. They’re struggling with <strong>too many tools, unclear rules, and broken workflows.</strong></p>

<p>I’ve learned that the biggest wins don’t come from flashy demos. They come from boring, practical systems that quietly remove friction.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  My focus: internal tools, not hype
</h3>

<p>In my work as an AI Solutions Manager, I spend most of my time building internal applications and workflows that:</p>

<ul>
<li>replace spreadsheets and manual processes</li>
<li>automate repetitive QA and product tasks</li>
<li>make complex data accessible to non-technical users</li>
<li>introduce AI in ways that are secure, governed, and useful</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal isn’t “AI everywhere.”<br>
The goal is less chaos and better decisions.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  What’s worked surprisingly well
</h3>

<p>A few patterns I’ve seen consistently work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Start with real pain</strong><br>
If a process is already broken or slow, AI can help. If it’s fine, AI will probably make it worse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hide the complexity</strong><br>
Most users don’t want prompts, models, or configuration. They want a button that solves their problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Governance matters early</strong><br>
Clear rules around approved tools, data usage, and access save a lot of future headaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Internal tools beat external SaaS (sometimes)</strong><br>
Lightweight internal apps can replace expensive tools and fit workflows better than generic platforms.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Beyond enterprise work
</h3>

<p>Outside of corporate environments, I also work on product and marketing systems through my own projects. That mix—enterprise constraints + scrappy experimentation—has shaped how I think about building things that last.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Why I’m writing here
</h3>

<p>I’m not here to sell “AI magic.”<br>
I’m here to share what actually works when you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>dealing with real users</li>
<li>real data</li>
<li>real constraints</li>
</ul>

<p>On this blog, I’ll write about:</p>

<ul>
<li>practical AI use cases</li>
<li>internal tools and automation</li>
<li>product thinking</li>
<li>Lessons learned from building systems in the real world</li>
</ul>

<p>If that sounds useful, say hey 👋</p>
