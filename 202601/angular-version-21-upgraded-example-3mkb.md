<p>This Angular web application was the first one I developed - as a self-directed study - in 2020, has been upgraded recently from Angular version 20 to Angular version 21, and has been upgraded regularly since its Angular version 8 inception <a href="https://listings-d5ac7.web.app/home" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://listings-d5ac7.web.app/home</a></p>

<p>Upgrading to Angular version 21 provides significant benefits centered on performance, developer experience, and modern architecture, particularly through the full implementation of the standalone APIs and signal-based reactivity.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Key benefits of upgrading to Angular 21 include:
</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Performance Improvements</strong>: New applications use zoneless change detection by default. Build optimizations, such as esbuild/Vite integration, lead to faster application rendering, smaller bundle sizes (up to 40% reduction), and quicker build times.</li>
<li>
<strong>Simplified Reactivity with Signals</strong>: Signals are fully integrated, providing a more straightforward method to manage state. This reduces the need for complex RxJS patterns for basic UI updates.</li>
<li>
<strong>Enhanced Server-Side Rendering (SSR) &amp; SEO</strong>: Improvements to SSR and hydration, such as SSR streaming and faster hydration, result in better Core Web Vitals, improved SEO, and a better user experience.</li>
</ol>
