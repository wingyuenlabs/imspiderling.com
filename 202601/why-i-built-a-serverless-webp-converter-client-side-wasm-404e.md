<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> I got tired of waiting for slow upload bars just to convert a 50KB WebP image. Plus, uploading private screenshots to a random server feels wrong.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I built a "Zero-Server" tool. It runs entirely in the browser using JavaScript and Canvas processing.</p>

<p><strong>No Uploads:</strong> Your file never leaves localhost.</p>

<p><strong>No Limits:</strong> Batch process 100 files if you want.</p>

<p><strong>The Tool:</strong> <a href="https://sheldons.it" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sheldons.it</a></p>

<p>It’s a simple tool for a simple problem. Hope it helps anyone else who hates "freemium" file converters, I'll be adding more converters soon!</p>
