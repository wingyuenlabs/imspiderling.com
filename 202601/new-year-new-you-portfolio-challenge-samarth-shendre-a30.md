<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Samarth Shendre</strong>, a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in <strong>AI/ML, cloud technologies, and building real-world solutions</strong>. Over the past year, I’ve actively participated in hackathons, open-source programs, and technical communities, which helped me strengthen both my technical skills and problem-solving mindset.</p>

<p>This portfolio is a reflection of my journey — showcasing what I’ve learned, built, and experimented with. I wanted it to feel <strong>simple, honest, and purposeful</strong>, while clearly representing my interests in AI-driven and cloud-native development.</p>

  🛠️ How I Built It
</h2>

<p><strong>Tech Stack</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript
</li>
<li>
<strong>Deployment:</strong> GitHub Pages
</li>
<li>
<strong>Design Approach:</strong> Minimal, responsive, and content-focused
</li>
</ul>

<p>While building this portfolio, I focused on keeping the UI clean and readable, avoiding unnecessary complexity. I took inspiration from modern developer portfolios and aimed for a structure that allows visitors to quickly understand <strong>who I am and what I work on</strong>.</p>

<p>Google AI tools helped me refine content structure, improve clarity, and think more intentionally about how I present my work and learning journey.</p>
