  What Does This Template Do?
</h2>

<p>If you've ever wanted to automatically create short clips from long YouTube videos, this template is for you. It watches a YouTube channel of your choice, and whenever a new video is published, it uses AI to generate engaging short clips perfect for social media. You get notified by email when your clip is ready to download.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How It Works
</h2>

<p>The workflow is straightforward and runs completely on autopilot:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Monitor YouTube channels</strong> - The template watches the RSS feed of any YouTube channel you specify. When a new video appears, the automation kicks off.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request AI clip generation</strong> - Using Reka's Vision API, the workflow sends the video for AI processing. You have full control over the output:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a custom prompt to guide the AI on what kind of clip to create</li>
<li>Choose whether to include captions</li>
<li>Set minimum and maximum clip duration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Smart status checking</strong> - When the clips are ready, you receive a success email with your download link. As a safety feature, if the job takes too long, you'll get an error notification instead.</p></li>
</ol>
