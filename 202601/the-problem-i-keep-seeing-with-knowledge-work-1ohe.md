<p>I keep running into the same issue, no matter the organisation, the sector, or how smart the people are.</p>

<p>The work is good.<br>
The effort is real.<br>
And yet, very little of it actually gets used.</p>

<p>I have seen this in research teams, policy environments, internal strategy groups, and organisations that genuinely care about evidence and clarity. The intent is almost always there. The output usually is too.</p>

<p>What is missing is access.</p>

<p>Publishing feels like the finish line</p>

<p>Once a report is written, reviewed, approved, and published, there is a sense of relief. Something concrete exists. The work has an endpoint.</p>

<p>From inside an organisation, this makes complete sense. Publishing is a familiar process. It is easy to track. It fits how teams are structured.</p>

<p>From the outside, it often falls apart.</p>

<p>Most people are not looking for documents. They are looking for answers.</p>

<p>People do not think in PDFs</p>

<p>What I notice again and again is that readers arrive with questions, not with time.</p>

<p>They want to know what an organisation actually recommends.<br>
They want to understand how a position has changed.<br>
They want to check whether a claim still holds up.<br>
They want to see where something came from.</p>

<p>Handing them a long document and expecting them to piece that together is asking a lot. Especially when they are on a phone, short on time, or trying to make a decision.</p>

<p>Search inside a document helps a little, but only if you already know what you are looking for and if the wording matches exactly.</p>

<p>Most of the time, it does not.</p>

<p>The quiet cost of unread knowledge</p>

<p>When knowledge is hard to access, a few things start to happen.</p>

<p>People rely on summaries instead of sources.<br>
Outdated information stays in circulation.<br>
Different teams interpret the same work differently.<br>
Institutional memory slowly erodes.</p>

<p>None of this happens because the work lacks quality. It happens because the interface between the work and the reader is fragile.</p>

<p>Over time, trust takes a hit. Not because the organisation is wrong, but because clarity is missing.</p>

<p>Access is the real bottleneck</p>

<p>I have come to believe that most organisations do not have a knowledge problem. They have an access problem.</p>

<p>They already know more than they can easily surface. Their insight is buried across years of reports, inconsistent language, and static formats.</p>

<p>The more they publish, the harder it becomes for anyone, including their own teams, to answer simple questions with confidence.</p>

<p>That is the paradox that keeps showing up.</p>

<p>What I am trying to explore</p>

<p>Lately, I have been spending my time thinking about what better access actually looks like.</p>

<p>Not more dashboards.<br>
Not longer executive summaries.<br>
Not another place to upload files.</p>

<p>But systems that let people ask questions in plain language, get grounded answers, and see exactly where those answers come from.</p>

<p>That line of thinking is what led me to start working on a project called Answerable, which is an attempt to rethink how research and institutional knowledge is accessed rather than just published. If you are curious, it lives here: (<a href="https://www.answerable.tech" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.answerable.tech</a>).</p>

<p>This post is not about that product though.</p>

<p>It is about a pattern I keep seeing, and a belief that if we care about evidence and understanding, we need to pay far more attention to how people actually interact with knowledge once it leaves our hands.</p>

<p>Documents are not the enemy, but they cannot be the interface</p>

<p>PDFs and reports still have their place. They are useful records. They matter for accountability and depth.</p>

<p>They just should not be the only way people are expected to understand complex ideas.</p>

<p>When the interface fails, the knowledge gets blamed.<br>
That feels like the wrong conclusion.</p>

<p>If we want better decisions, better debate, and better use of research, access has to be treated as part of the work, not something that happens after it.</p>
