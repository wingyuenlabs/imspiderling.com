<p><em>Hello everyone. Today I want to share who I am, what I'm building, and why.</em></p>

<p>You might ask: "Do we really need another developer building tools? Aren't there enough companies already?" Yes, there are. But to understand Mendex, we need to go back — long before it existed.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  The Beginning
</h2>

<p>17 years ago, I started my career as a developer at a large company in Europe. Everything began well — I had discipline, ambition, and a hunger to grow. I worked full-time during the day and attended university at night.</p>

<p>Things were going well. But day by day, I started feeling tired. A tiredness that wouldn't go away with sleep. That wouldn't fade with weekends or vacations. Nothing stopped it.</p>

<p>Until one day, I wasn't myself anymore.</p>

<p>I couldn't control my emotions. I cried. I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't work. For the first time, a doctor sedated me. I spent days sleeping.</p>

<p><strong>That was my first burnout.</strong> It came silently and changed my life forever.</p>

<p>The same thing would happen three more times over the years.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  The Search for Answers
</h2>

<p>For years, I consulted specialists trying to understand what was wrong with me. The answers were always the same. I felt like a lab rat — medication X, then Y, then Z. Nothing worked.</p>

<p>I never stopped trying to figure out why I was different. Why I seemed weaker than everyone around me. Why I couldn't reach my goals.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  The Fall
</h2>

<p>In 2017, while recovering from my second major burnout, the worst happened.</p>

<p>I was hospitalized with severe respiratory failure. Critical values. I fought to survive. I fought to keep trying.</p>

<p>But I came out carrying something new: <strong>severe asthma</strong>.</p>

<p>I don't know if there's a connection between years of fighting burnout and my respiratory condition awakening. But here I was.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being extremely careful, I was infected four times. Each time, I managed to overcome it — with difficulty, but I survived.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  The Discovery
</h2>

<p>In 2025, after countless professionals and years of searching, my answers finally arrived.</p>

<p>I discovered I'm neurodivergent. I have <strong>AuDHD</strong> — both autism and ADHD.</p>

<p>For 37 years, I had been playing life's game with the wrong rulebook.</p>

<p>The news made me incredibly happy. Finally, I had my answer. But it also brought immense sadness. I had lived my entire life the wrong way. That's why I never achieved what I wanted. And now, finding work would be even harder.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  The Final Blow
</h2>

<p>I thought I was ready to start again. But life had one more thing to throw at me.</p>

<p>Its name: <strong>PRISm</strong>.</p>

<p>After fighting so hard to integrate into society the right way, my body said <em>enough</em>. I don't know if it did it for me or against me. It's hard to understand when your lung capacity is reduced by 31% — and likely progressing.</p>

<p>This one took me to the bottom.</p>

<p>I survived so much, and now I'm facing a condition that requires me to protect myself at all costs. I cannot risk another burnout — the implications could accelerate the PRISm.</p>

<p>And my country, which promises to care for its people? It considered me a disposable asset and discarded me accordingly. I have no right to any support. No concern for helping me. In their eyes, I'm no longer useful to society.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why Mendex Exists
</h2>

<p>The sadness. The anger. They led me to start <strong>Mendex</strong>.</p>

<p>I will work for myself. By myself. With one mission:</p>

<p><strong>To help people like me — solo developers, startups, small businesses — the right way.</strong></p>

<p>Self-hosted tools that respect privacy in a world where privacy becomes harder to maintain every day.</p>

<p>I will never compromise my principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open source first</li>
<li>Privacy by default
</li>
<li>Fair pricing for those who need advanced features</li>
<li>No venture capital, no growth-at-all-costs mentality</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  How Do I Survive?
</h2>

<p>Right now, on the absolute minimum. No going out. No treatments I can't afford. Not spending a single cent I don't have to.</p>

<p>With open source, my only path to sustainability is people who want to join the Mendex community. Follow my story. Use my products. Become sponsors of this journey.</p>

<p>There are many surprises to come.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  "What If It Doesn't Work?"
</h2>

<p>It will work.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have no other options. My health is degraded. But giving up? I will never do that.</p>

<p>Because if I were going to give up, I might as well not be here at all.</p>

<p><strong>And I'm here. Alive. Fighting.</strong></p>
