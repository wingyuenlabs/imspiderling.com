<p>So I just built a Windows network security application that monitors connections, manages firewall rules, and controls remote access for FREE. You can look at all of the features and details here: <a href="https://github.com/FreeCoderExperience/SecuriNET" rel="noopener noreferrer">SecuriNET</a>, anyway the goal was to create an application that serves an ever lasting need of greater security. My hope with this is that many people will contribute to this project in some way, and together we can better the security posture of the businesses and those who don't have the funding for professional/enterprise security. Security should be a standard, not a premium solution.</p>

<p>If you like the project, please consider starring it or contributing—and help spread the word! Even just one star could help this reach someone who needs it.</p>
