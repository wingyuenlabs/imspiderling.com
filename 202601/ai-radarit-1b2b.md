<p>Hi All, happy to join the community.<br>
Being an AI Enthusiast, I started studying how LLMs works, reading many books and practicing via Google Colab, Hugging Face and Kaggle, developing multiple AI related Apps, using VS Code and Google Antigravity. Here my small contribution named ai-radar.it. it's a news aggregator entirely done vibe coding with vscode and Antigravity. Most of the contents are phyton related, lot of HF libraries used and a local running Ollama 3b use for some of the tasks. The rest of the ai related tasks are handled via GenAI. A rag with Chromadb is present to contextualize the answers proposed by the Internal Chatbot named Ask Observatory. A LLM calculator is available to understand according to your HW (just RAm for now) if you can run LLM on Premise and which. Have a look if you want :) Davide</p>
