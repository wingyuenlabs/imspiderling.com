  Jeff's January 2026 Dev Closeout: AI is Rewriting the Engineer Playbook
</h1>

<p>Hey devs—if you're vibe-coding your way through this AI explosion like I am, buckle up. ClaudeMAX as a CLI agent has become my most obedient engineer ever. No egos, no career drama—just pure execution. It's the inflection point where deep IC skills are commoditized, and leadership means amplifying machine leverage for everyone. Let's break down my pivot.</p>

  Adama Platform: Pausing for the AI Era
</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.adama-platform.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adama Platform</a> was my big bet, but the market shifted. AI agents like Claude handle what Adama promised faster and cheaper. It's not a total failure—more a vanity project timing out against hyperspeed tools. I'll keep <a href="https://www.adama-platform.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adama</a> alive as hobby infra to fight brain atrophy. Prediction: It might have a second coming once we teach AIs to leverage its cost savings. For now, I'm deepening my AI fluency to make that happen.</p>

  Vibe-Coding a Game Studio with AI
</h2>

<p>Priorities? Experimentation is the new priority—shipping is instantaneous. I'm building a mobile game studio, vibe-coding three playable games and a bigger one. Check the open-source repos: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/nexivibe/repositories" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/orgs/nexivibe/repositories</a>. I haven't even peeked at the code; AI suffered to build it all.</p>

<p>Practical twist: Vibe-coded two tools for image assets while prototyping. Crawling now, but next—replace ad-riddled simple games with mine. Example: Spider Solitaire cranked to six suits for masochistic difficulty, plus "time attack" modes across all games. Perfect for timing gym rest periods (productivity hack: gamify everything).</p>

<p>App store LLC setup will take longer than cranking out games. "The marginal is no longer marginal"—ship fast, iterate wild.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Human Edge in an AI World
</h2>

<p>What’s left for us humans? Creativity + leverage. I'm hyper-optimistic: This era rewards those who experiment and ship. Balance is key—stay hands-on to avoid atrophy, but let machines grind.</p>

<p>Intend to write more on tool dev for the studio. Follow me on <a href="https://x.com/mathgladiator" rel="noopener noreferrer">X</a> for updates.</p>

<p>Ship yours—what's your next vibe-code experiment?</p>
