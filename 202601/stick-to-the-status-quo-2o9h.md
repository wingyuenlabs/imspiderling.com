<p>While watching a <strong>LIVE 24/7: High School Musical 1 on YouTube</strong> this morning, I realized…</p>

<p><strong>“Stick to the Status Quo”</strong> is basically the unofficial anthem of everyone telling founders what <strong>NOT</strong> to do. It low-key feels like a startup founder experience in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Everyone’s basically saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>“Ganito na yan.”<br>
“Follow what already works.”<br>
“Wag na mag-iba.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But… startups literally exist because someone didn’t follow that advice.</p>

<p>A lot of Filipino founders don’t fit one box — and that’s the point. Tech founders who care about community impact. Creatives building real businesses. Innovators solving very local problems with very new ideas. The ecosystem doesn’t always know what to do with that, so there’s pushback.</p>

<p>Breaking from the norm is uncomfortable — especially when resources are tight and the risk feels personal. But every meaningful startup in the PH started with someone asking, <em><strong>“What if we try something different?”</strong></em></p>

<p>So no, <strong><em>founders don’t stick to the status quo</em></strong>.<br>
We <strong>question</strong> it. We <strong>remix</strong> it. We <strong>build</strong> anyway.</p>

<p>And sometimes, <strong><em>that’s how real change starts — when we get’cha head in the game</em></strong>.  <em><strong>twinks</strong></em></p>
