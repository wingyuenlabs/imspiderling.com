<p>CES is still the biggest stage in tech, but CES 2026 was not just about new gadgets. The stronger signal was about trust, security, and how AI integrates into real life. For developers and product teams, those topics are no longer optional add-ons. They are part of what users expect from the start.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Trust is becoming the headline
</h2>

<p>Samsung's CES 2026 panel, "In Tech We Trust? Rethinking Security &amp; Privacy in the AI Age," made the point directly: adoption is gated by trust, not hype. The themes were familiar to anyone building in this space: <strong>transparency</strong>, <strong>predictability</strong>, and <strong>user control</strong>. The conversation around on-device versus cloud AI was not just about performance; it was framed as a privacy decision that users should be able to understand. The full panel context is captured in <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-trust-security-privacy-future-ai-ces-2026/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung's release</a>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Security is shifting from feature to foundation
</h2>

<p>One of the quiet but meaningful signals at CES 2026 was the recognition of post-quantum security in mainstream hardware. Samsung's new security chip, supported by Thales' secure OS, won a cybersecurity innovation award and embeds <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography" rel="noopener noreferrer">post-quantum cryptography</a>. That is not marketing garnish; it is a signal that encryption and future-proofing are moving into the baseline expectations of products. The award context is on the <a href="https://www.ces.tech/ces-innovation-awards/" rel="noopener noreferrer">CES Innovation Awards page</a>, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/valleephilippe_ces-activity-7414332388635500544-o_Z8" rel="noopener noreferrer">social coverage here</a>.</p>

<p>For software teams, this shifts the bar. "It's encrypted" is not enough anymore. The real question is whether security is provable, consistent, and resilient as systems evolve.</p>

  Privacy backlash is already real

</p>

<p>CES 2026 also surfaced the other side of the trust story. Consumer advocacy groups issued <a href="https://www.worstinshowces.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Worst in Show" anti-awards</a> for AI products viewed as invasive or careless with data. That pushback was widely covered, including by the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/0ce7fbc5aff68e8ff6d7b8e6fb7b007d" rel="noopener noreferrer">AP</a>.</p>

<p>This matters because it highlights the gap between industry messaging and user sentiment. <strong>Trust cannot be claimed; it is earned through predictable behavior and clear boundaries.</strong></p>

<h2>
  
  
  AI everywhere does not mean secure by default
</h2>

<p>General coverage of CES 2026 shows how pervasive AI has become across devices and platforms, but security and trust are only now moving to the forefront. The broader narrative is captured <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ces-2026-coverage-hints-ai-plateau-are-consumers-still-impressed-1768623" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This is where product teams need to slow down and decide what they want to be known for. Capability draws attention, but trust keeps users.</strong></p>

<h2>
  
  
  What this means for builders
</h2>

<p>Trust and security are now product differentiators. <strong>Users care about where data is processed, what is retained, and how much control they actually have.</strong> The systems that win are not the most clever. They are the most predictable.</p>

<p>This is the same mindset behind Ghostable's security model. Secrets are encrypted locally, access is device-bound, and changes are versioned so teams can prove what happened without exposing values. If you want a deeper look at the security boundary, the <a href="https://ghostable.dev/blog/ghostable-v2-zero-knowledge-security" rel="noopener noreferrer">zero-knowledge architecture overview</a> lays it out.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Closing thought
</h2>

<p>CES 2026 made one thing clear: trust is the next competitive frontier for AI products. As connected platforms get smarter and more autonomous, trust will be the feature users notice most. That is why we build <a href="https://ghostable.dev" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghostable</a> the way we do.</p>
