  Hello everyone — quick update on the HRT Journey Tracker Suite project.
</h2>

<p>I’m actively working on a secure, privacy‑focused web app version of the suite using Replit as my development environment. My goal is to create a safe, accessible space for trans folks to track their HRT journey without sacrificing autonomy or data privacy. Everything is being designed with local‑first principles, no accounts, no analytics, and no unnecessary data collection.<br>
Right now I’m learning how to structure the project in Replit, and making sure the whole system stays transparent, secure, and community‑centered. It’s a big shift from desktop‑only tools, but I’m excited about the possibilities.<br>
If you have experience with:<br>
•     Replit workflows or best practices<br>
•     Privacy‑first web app design<br>
•     Secure API integration<br>
•     Local‑first or offline‑friendly architectures<br>
•     Accessibility workflows in no‑code/low‑code or hybrid tools<br>
…I would really appreciate any guidance, resources, or feedback.<br>
This project is built for the community, and I want to make sure I’m doing it right. Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance to anyone willing to share their knowledge.</p>

<p>🌱 A Small Quality‑of‑Life Update: Renaming the App to Bloom<br>
I’m also making a small but meaningful quality‑of‑life improvement:<br>
I’m renaming the entire suite from “HRT Journey Tracker Suite” to “Bloom.”<br>
The new name is shorter, cleaner, easier to say, and better reflects the growth‑focused, affirming spirit of the project. It also makes the ecosystem feel more cohesive as it expands into multiple tools and platforms.</p>

<p>🖥️🌐 Why I’m Also Building a Web Version<br>
I want to explain why I’m taking the web‑app route at all.<br>
I’m not dropping the desktop app. I’m building the desktop Python version and the web version at the same time, and that’s exactly why things get overwhelming. The desktop version requires a lot of pure Python work — UI, architecture, state management, packaging — and I’m still growing as a developer. Every time I push forward on the desktop build, I hit a wall and come to a complete stop, and then the cycle repeats.<br>
Starting the web version has its own learning curve. Juggling both paths at once is a lot, and that’s where the overwhelm comes from. I’m using Replit because it gives me a more structured, contained environment to keep moving when I hit a wall.<br>
Both versions matter. Both versions are being built. I’m just taking the route that lets me keep making progress instead of getting stuck.</p>

It’s absolutely not finished — lots of things are rough, missing, or experimental — but having fresh eyes on it would really help. Any feedback, suggestions, or accessibility notes are deeply appreciated as I keep shaping Bloom into something truly community‑centered.</p>
