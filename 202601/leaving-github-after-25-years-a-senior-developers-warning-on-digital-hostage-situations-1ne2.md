<p>The Incident: 22 days ago, my GitHub account (active for years, clean record, paying Copilot subscriber) was suspended without a single email or explanation. My work, including tools supporting research in Antarctica, was instantly turned into 404 pages.</p>

<p>The Reality Check: Despite 25 years of engineering experience and a paid subscription, I’ve been met with total silence. My professional email addresses are now "trapped" in their system, and I cannot move my identity elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Lesson:</p>

<ol>
<li>Copilot is a productivity trap: The seconds it saves you are nothing compared to the weeks lost in "support limbo."</li>
<li>99% of GitHub is noise: Most solutions are mediocre; don't waste your time building a reputation on a platform that treats you like a row in a database.</li>
<li>The ROI isn't there: I have spent more time fighting their bots than I ever gained from their services.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Future: I am moving my work to independent channels. My code is safe in my local archives. GitHub is no longer part of my workflow. If you value your time and autonomy, have a "Plan B".</p>
