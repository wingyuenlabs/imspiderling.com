<p>We often introduce ourselves by our current titles. <em>"I'm a Frontend Developer"</em> <em>"I'm an Engineer"</em> But those labels are just snapshots. To truly understand why i write code today, you have to understand where the urge to create came from.</p>

<p>A year and a half ago, I made a massive leap. I walked away from the world of Textile Engineering to commit myself to Software Engineering. It wasn't just a career pivot; it was a translation of skills. I went from understanding how threads weave together to form fabric, to understanding how lines of logic weave together to form experiences.</p>

<p>But long before I ever touched a keyboard, I was an artist or music producer.</p>

<p>Since I was a kid, I’ve been obsessed with the act of bringing the internal world out into the external one. It started with drawing—pencil on paper, capturing silence. Then, it evolved into sound.</p>

<p>For a long time, music was my primary language. I spent years in production, shaping frequencies, layering rhythms, and trying to capture a specific emotion in a track. I learned that a small tweak in timing or a shift in tone could change how a listener felt.</p>

<p>You can actually still hear that part of my soul on my <a href="https://zezo.bandcamp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bandcamp</a> or  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3o4OXXvSzxsUrnvnnXeXnP?si=s-OhvW3JTDGZ4bdWPGp1ug" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a> . That music is still very much a part of who I am.</p>

<p><strong>So, why the web?</strong></p>

<p>I realized that Creative Development isn't leaving art behind; it's just a new instrument.</p>

<p>When I dive deep into code now, exploring the intersection of Frontend and Motion, I’m using the same muscles I used in music. The rhythm of an animation, the harmony of a layout, the texture of a user interface; it’s all composition.</p>

<p>I build websites because I have a restless desire to get my perspective out there. I don’t just want to make things that function; I want to make things that resonate. I want a stranger to visit a link I deployed and feel a part of themselves in what I’ve made, or maybe feel inspired to chase their own obscure ideas.</p>

<p><strong>The Current Canvas</strong></p>

<p>I am currently working full-time as a Frontend Developer, and I am obsessed with the craft. I am pushing myself toward mastering Design and UI/UX because I believe the line between "coder" and "designer" should be blurred.</p>

<p>I’m not at the finish line yet. I haven't built my <strong>"Magnum Opus"</strong> or the dream portfolio that perfectly visualizes everything in my head. But I am building. I am learning. I am refining my taste every single day to reach the level of the things that inspire me.</p>

<p>If you are curious about where my skills are at right now, you can see my latest <strong>"demo tape"</strong> <em>"my portfolio"</em> below. It’s a snapshot of my current ability to weave code into art.</p>

<p>I’d love to connect with other developers who view code as a creative medium. If you check out the work or listen to the tracks, let me know if it lands.</p>
