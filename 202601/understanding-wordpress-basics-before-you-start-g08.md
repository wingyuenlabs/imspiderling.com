<p>So you decided you want to create a website and put it on the internet.<br>
Is the only way to do that by talking code to a computer?<br>
<em>No</em></p>

<p>Today we also have GUIs (graphical user interfaces) for this, and WordPress was made exactly for that reason.</p>

<p>Around 42–48% of all websites in the world are built with WordPress, which already tells you a lot about how powerful and accessible it is.</p>

<p>Content types in WordPress:</p>

<p>In WordPress, there are <strong>three</strong> main types of content you can give to a website:</p>

<h2>
  
  
  1. Blog posts (Posts)
</h2>

<p>It also has a dedicated button in the WordPress dashboard.</p>

<p>It’s meant for:<br>
blogs<br>
articles<br>
long text-based content<br>
content that grows over time</p>

<p>Blog posts are usually managed and enhanced by blog-focused plugins.<br>
One popular plugin used to extend content structures is <strong>JetEngine</strong>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  2.Pages (what you visually build)
</h2>

<p>Pages are more similar to what developers imagine when they think about structure.</p>

<p>They are:<br>
visual layouts<br>
sections + components<br>
built using page builders</p>

<p>The most famous one is <strong>Elementor</strong>.</p>

<p>Pages have their own section in the dashboard, and you usually use them for:<br>
Home<br>
About<br>
Services<br>
Contact<br>
Landing pages</p>

<p>Think of pages as designed layouts, not streams of content.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  3. Custom Content Types (CCT / CPT)
</h2>

<p>This is where WordPress becomes more powerful.</p>

<p>Custom Content Types are structured content, similar to data stored in tables:<br>
products<br>
events<br>
courses<br>
team members<br>
portfolio items</p>

<p>You can compare them to rows in a database table, where each item has fields (title, price, image, date, etc.).</p>

<p>They are not “pages” and not “blogs”, but reusable structured data.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Themes: the foundation of your site
</h2>

<p>When you create a site, the first thing you choose is a <strong>theme</strong>.</p>

<p>A theme decides:</p>

<p>typography<br>
spacing<br>
base layout<br>
general visual rules</p>

<p>Some themes are very flexible, like Astra, which means:</p>

<p>easy to customize<br>
works well with page builders<br>
doesn’t lock you into a rigid structure</p>

<p>Other themes are more opinionated, meaning:<br>
harder to modify<br>
more constraints<br>
faster setup but less freedom</p>

<p><em>Choose your theme wisely, because it affects everything that comes after.</em></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Templates (often confused, very important)
</h2>

<p>After themes, we arrive at templates.</p>

<p>There are two types of templates:</p>

<ol>
<li>Templates you create yourself</li>
</ol>

<p>These are templates you build using Elementor (or another page builder).<br>
They are basically reusable layouts.</p>

<ol>
<li>Inserted / imported templates</li>
</ol>

<p>These come from:<br>
template kits<br>
external libraries...</p>

<p><em>Important rule:<br>
Once you create a page using a specific template, you can’t just switch the template.<br>
You usually need to create a new page if you want a different structure.</em></p>

<p>Templates are basically sets of components, reused across pages.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Plugins (extra powers):
</h2>

<p>Plugins are how you add functionality to WordPress.</p>

<p>If you come from a coding background:<br>
plugins are like libraries<br>
they extend what WordPress can do</p>

<p>Too many plugins is not good:</p>

<p>slower site<br>
conflicts<br>
harder maintenance</p>

<p>Some very famous plugins:<br>
WooCommerce → adds an entire e-commerce system<br>
Elementor → visual page builder<br>
Security plugins → protect your site<br>
SEO plugins → help search engines understand your content</p>

<p><strong>Each plugin adds power, but also responsibility.</strong></p>

<p><em>Final thought?<br>
WordPress lets you build websites without writing code, but understanding how it works makes a huge difference.</em></p>
