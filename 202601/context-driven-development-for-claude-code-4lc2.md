<p>I’ve been using this Claude Code framework and loving it!</p>

<p>It is an enhancement from the Gemini extensions “conductor” , it’s a “context-driven development “ approach.</p>

<p>Context -&gt; Spec &amp; Plan -&gt; Implement</p>

<p>It basically scans your project at the beginning to build a overview of its stacks and guidelines, them it tracks each change you want to make “/conductor:newTrack” and you implement whenever trough “/conductor:implement” and it auto injects SKILLS defined in the plugin as well</p>

<p>It has some python scripts to automate some tasks to reduce token consumption and time.</p>

<p>Check it out</p>
