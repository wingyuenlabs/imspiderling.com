  About Me
</h2>

<p>I'm excited to share my updated developer portfolio for the Google AI "New Year, New You" Challenge! I wanted to start 2026 with a fresh, modern site to showcase my projects and skills.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How I Built It
</h2>

<p>I leveraged Google's AI ecosystem to speed up development and solve technical challenges, utilizing Gemini Code Assist as an AI pair programmer to generate component structures, write complex CSS animations, and ideate creative design solutions like 3D map visualizations. This setup significantly reduced context switching and maintained my coding flow while debugging in real-time. </p>

<p>Additionally, I used the Gemini CLI to interact with the model directly from my terminal, allowing me to bootstrap features, refactor code, and efficiently implement technical requirements like dark and light mode support.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What I'm Most Proud Of
</h2>

<p>Honestly, the biggest win for me wasn't just the new portfolio—it was the inspiration. Participating in this challenge and exploring Google's AI ecosystem actually sparked the idea for my latest project, "My Baby Name".</p>

<p>I used this opportunity to dive deep into the Google Gemini API, Gemini CLI, building a full-stack application around it. This challenge pushed me to gain new skills in generative AI integration, and this portfolio is now the perfect home to showcase that journey.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio, and good luck to all participants! 🚀</p>
