<p>*<em>What Is Version Control?<br>
*</em><br>
Version control is a system that helps you keep track of changes made to files over time.</p>

<p>Instead of manually saving multiple copies of a project with different names, version control allows you to:</p>

<p>Save different versions of your work</p>

<p>See what changed and when</p>

<p>Restore older versions if something goes wrong</p>

<p>Work confidently without fear of losing progress</p>

<p>In simple terms, version control acts like a history book for your project.</p>

<p>*<em>What Is Git?<br>
*</em><br>
Git is a version control system used by developers to manage changes in their projects.</p>

<p>Git works on your local computer and helps you:</p>

<p>Monitor file changes</p>

<p>Save progress in organized steps</p>

<p>Keep a clear record of your work</p>

<p>Experiment safely with new ideas</p>

<p>Every time you save your progress in Git, it creates a snapshot of your project. These snapshots allow you to move back and forth between different versions.</p>

<p>*<em>What Is GitHub and How Is It Related to Git?<br>
*</em><br>
GitHub is an online platform where Git projects are stored.</p>

<p>While Git works on your computer, GitHub:</p>

<p>Stores your project online</p>

<p>Acts as a backup for your work</p>

<p>Allows multiple people to work on the same project</p>

<p>Makes collaboration possible from anywhere in the world</p>

<p>Think of Git as the tool you use locally, and GitHub as the cloud where your work is shared and saved.</p>

<p>*<em>How Git Tracks Changes<br>
*</em><br>
Git does not automatically save everything you do. Instead, it follows a structured process that gives you full control.</p>

<p>There are three main stages in Git:</p>

<p>_1. Working Area<br>
_<br>
This is where you make changes to your files. Nothing is saved yet.</p>

<p>_2. Staging Area<br>
_<br>
Here, you choose which changes you want Git to remember. This step allows you to review your work before saving it.</p>

<p>_3. Saved Version (Commit)<br>
_<br>
Once changes are saved, Git records them as a version in your project history.</p>

<p>This process helps prevent mistakes and keeps your project organized.</p>

<p>*<em>What Does “Tracking Changes” Mean?<br>
*</em><br>
Tracking changes means Git keeps a detailed record of:</p>

<p>What files were changed</p>

<p>What was added or removed</p>

<p>When the change happened</p>

<p>Who made the change</p>

<p>This makes it easy to:</p>

<p>Understand your project’s history</p>

<p>Find errors</p>

<p>Work with others without confusion</p>

<p>For beginners, this is one of Git’s most powerful features.</p>

<p>*<em>What Does “Push” Mean in Git?<br>
*</em><br>
Push means sending your saved work from your computer to GitHub.</p>

<p>When you push your work:</p>

<p>Your project is backed up online</p>

<p>Others can see your updates</p>

<p>Your changes become part of the shared project</p>

<p>You can think of pushing as uploading your work to the cloud.</p>

<p>*<em>What Does “Pull” Mean in Git?<br>
*</em><br>
Pull means bringing changes from GitHub down to your computer.</p>

<p>Pulling is useful when:</p>

<p>You are working on more than one device</p>

<p>Other people have updated the project</p>

<p>You want the latest version of the work</p>

<p>Pulling ensures your local project stays up to date.</p>

<p>*<em>Push vs Pull (Simple Explanation)<br>
*</em><br>
Push sends changes from your computer to GitHub</p>

<p>Pull brings changes from GitHub to your computer</p>

<p>Together, they keep everything synchronized.</p>

<p>Why Version Control Is Important for Beginners</p>

<p>Version control helps beginners by:</p>

<p>Preventing loss of work</p>

<p>Encouraging experimentation</p>

<p>Making mistakes easier to fix</p>

<p>Teaching professional development practices</p>

<p>Preparing you for real-world team projects</p>

<p>Even solo developers benefit greatly from using Git.</p>

<p>*<em>Common Beginner Misunderstandings<br>
*</em><br>
Git does not automatically save your work</p>

<p>Pushing and pulling are different actions</p>

<p>Git and GitHub are not the same thing</p>

<p>You do not need to be an expert to use Git</p>

<p>Understanding these early makes learning easier.</p>

<p>*<em>Final Insights:<br>
*</em><br>
Git may seem overwhelming at first, but the core ideas are simple:</p>

<p>Git tracks changes</p>

<p>Version control saves history</p>

<p>Push uploads your work</p>

<p>Pull updates your work</p>

<p>You don’t need to know everything at once. Learning Git step by step will make your development journey smoother and more professional.</p>
