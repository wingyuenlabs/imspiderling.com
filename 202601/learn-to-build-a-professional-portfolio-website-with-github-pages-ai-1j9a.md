<p>This <a href="https://www.yourvrexperience.com/learn-to-build-a-professional-portfolio-website-with-github-pages-artificial-intelligence/" rel="noopener noreferrer">free course is a hands-on introduction to web development, digital creation, and professional workflows through the creation of a real, public portfolio website</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of learning web technologies in isolation, students apply concepts immediately by planning, building, testing, publishing, and improving a complete website using GitHub Pages, modern development tools, and AI as learning support — the same practices used in professional and academic environments.</p>

<p>This is not a course about copying AI-generated code.<br>
It is a course about understanding how websites work and learning how to create and improve them responsibly.</p>

<p>👥 <strong>Who is this course for?</strong><br>
This course is designed any kind of technical profile to develop skills in areas like:<br>
    • Technology and digital creation<br>
    • Web development and online portfolios<br>
    • Artificial intelligence as a learning tool<br>
    • Design, engineering, or computer science<br>
No prior experience with web development, GitHub, or AI is required.</p>

<p>🧠 <strong>What will students learn?</strong><br>
Throughout the course, students develop technical, cognitive, and transversal skills that are directly applicable to modern digital environments.<br>
🔹 <strong>Technical skills:</strong><br>
    • HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals<br>
    • Website publishing with GitHub Pages<br>
    • Professional development workflows<br>
    • Local development and version control<br>
    • Multi-page website creation and navigation<br>
🔹 <strong>Cognitive &amp; transversal skills:</strong><br>
    • Structured and logical thinking<br>
    • Planning before implementation<br>
    • Iterative problem-solving<br>
    • Debugging and error analysis<br>
    • Learning how to learn with AI<br>
🔹 <strong>Social &amp; collaborative skills:</strong><br>
    • Giving and receiving constructive feedback<br>
    • Collaborative improvement of digital projects<br>
    • Reflective practice<br>
    • Responsible use of AI tools</p>

<p>These competencies are transferable to any modern technological field, far beyond web development.</p>

<p>🧭 <strong>How is the course structured?</strong><br>
The course follows a guided, progressive learning journey, where each lesson builds directly on the previous one:<br>
    1. <strong>Foundations</strong>: Publishing a first website and understanding how code becomes a live product<br>
    2. <strong>Understanding code</strong>: Reading and modifying AI-generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br>
    3. <strong>Planning before coding</strong>: Designing website structure and layouts before generating code<br>
    4. <strong>Professional workflow</strong>: Local development, testing, and safe publishing<br>
    5. <strong>Creation &amp; iteration</strong>: Building new pages and components with AI as a development partner<br>
    6. <strong>Feedback &amp; improvement</strong>: Turning a static website into a living project through user feedback</p>

<p>Students always understand why they are learning a concept and how it fits into the complete website.</p>

<p>🤖 <strong>Responsible use of AI as learning support</strong><br>
Artificial intelligence is integrated as a learning assistant, not as a shortcut.<br>
    • Students receive prepared prompts aligned with lesson objectives<br>
    • AI helps explain concepts, support reasoning, and debug problems<br>
    • Solutions are not blindly copied<br>
    • Understanding and autonomy are always prioritized<br>
This approach mirrors how AI is increasingly used in education, research, and professional environments.</p>

<p>📊 <strong>How is learning evaluated?</strong><br>
Evaluation is designed to support learning and improvement, not create pressure.<br>
    • Continuous, competency-based assessment<br>
    • Emphasis on reasoning, process, and decision-making<br>
    • Errors are treated as learning opportunities<br>
    • Clear evaluation criteria shared in advance<br>
Students are evaluated on what they understand, how they work, and how they improve.</p>

<p>🎯 <strong>Final project</strong><br>
By the end of the course, students will have:<br>
    • Designed<br>
    • Built<br>
    • Tested<br>
    • Published<br>
    • Improved<br>
A fully functional, multi-page portfolio website, publicly accessible and ready to showcase their skills.</p>

<p>🚀 <strong>Why this course matters</strong><br>
In a world increasingly shaped by technology and artificial intelligence,<br>
understanding how digital systems work is essential.<br>
This course helps students move from being passive users of technology to becoming confident creators, problem-solvers, and critical thinkers — skills that are fundamental in today’s and tomorrow’s digital society.</p>
