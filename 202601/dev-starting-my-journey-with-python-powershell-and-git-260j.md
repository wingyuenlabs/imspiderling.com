<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>I’ve finally taken the plunge and joined the DEV community. I’m currently at the very beginning of my coding journey, and I’m focusing on three main tools:</p>

<p>Python - for logic and scripting.</p>

<p>PowerShell - for mastering the terminal.</p>

<p>Git - to keep track of everything I build locally.</p>

<p>I'm excited to learn from you all and eventually share my own progress.</p>

<p>Question for the community: What is one piece of advice you wish you had known when you first started learning to code?</p>
