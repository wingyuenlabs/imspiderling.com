<p>Every time I start a new Node.js project, I find myself wasting hours setting up the same authentication patterns: JWT handling, secure password hashing, database models, and Docker configs. It’s tedious, and if you miss one security step, the whole app is at risk.</p>

<p>To solve this, I built a comprehensive, enterprise-grade boilerplate that focuses on security and clean architecture, so you can just clone it and start building your actual business logic.</p>

<p>🛠 What’s Under the Hood?<br>
I focused on a professional architecture that goes beyond simple tutorials:</p>

<p>JWT Rotation Strategy: Implemented secure Access and Refresh token rotation with database-level revocation for extra security.</p>

<p>Security First: Out-of-the-box protection with Bcrypt hashing, rate limiting, and security headers (Helmet).</p>

<p>Clean Architecture: A layered structure (Controllers / Services / Models) using Sequelize for easy maintenance and scalability.</p>

<p>DevOps Ready: Fully containerized with Docker for a "plug and play" experience.</p>

<p>Professional Emails: Includes HTML email templates for authentication flows (welcome, reset password, etc.).</p>

<p>📖 Fully Documented<br>
I believe code is only as good as its documentation. I’ve included a full API reference and architectural map in the README to make it transparent and easy to use for developers of all levels.</p>

<p>🔗 Open Source &amp; Feedback<br>
I’m sharing the core of this architecture on GitHub. I’d love to get your feedback on the implementation or answer any technical questions you might have!</p>
