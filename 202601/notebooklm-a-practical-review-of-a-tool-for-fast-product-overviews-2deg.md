<p>Recently, I decided to try <strong>NotebookLM</strong> - a tool from Google designed to work with your own materials (documents, links, notes) using AI.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What I uploaded
</h2>

<p>A minimal setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>one Word document with a product description;</li>
<li>a link to the product landing page.</li>
</ul>

<p>No additional instructions, scripts, or manual preparation were required.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What the tool generated automatically
</h2>

<p>Based on the uploaded materials, NotebookLM:</p>

<ul>
<li>produced a coherent product description;</li>
<li>structured the content into logical slides;</li>
<li>generated voice narration;</li>
<li>assembled everything into a complete video overview.</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, this is an automated assembly of a product overview / demo-level presentation from raw input data.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How long it took
</h2>

<p>The generation process took approximately <strong>15–30 minutes</strong>.<br>
The output was a ready-to-use result that did not require further assembly or manual editing.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What felt especially useful
</h2>

<ul>
<li>it does not require a pre-written script;</li>
<li>it works well with existing documentation;</li>
<li>it is suitable for quick demos, internal presentations, and early-stage product overviews;</li>
<li>it lowers the effort required to prepare materials for external communication.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Limitations and nuances
</h2>

<ul>
<li>the quality of the result depends on the quality of the source documents;</li>
<li>it is not a replacement for a fully produced marketing video, but rather a fast, clear, and practical format.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Example output
</h2>

<p>As a real example, I applied NotebookLM to the description of one of my own products.<br>
Here is the automatically generated video overview:</p>

<p>NotebookLM is a strong practical tool for quickly packaging ideas and products into a clear, understandable format. It is especially useful when the goal is to communicate the core idea without spending time on manual presentation work.</p>
