<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I hope you are doing well.</p>

<p>My name is Md Niaz Morshed ([<a href="mailto:mmorshed@crimson.ua.edu">mmorshed@crimson.ua.edu</a>]), and I am a PhD candidate at the University of Alabama conducting an academic survey titled “Understanding Information Needs When Looking for Security Issues During Code Review in Open-Source Software (OSS).”</p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to better understand how developers identify and address security issues during peer code review in open-source projects. This study explores what information developers rely on, what tools they use, and what challenges they face when identifying security issues during OSS code reviews.</p>

<p>The survey is anonymous and intended solely for research purposes. Upon completing the survey, you will have the option to enter a raffle for a chance to receive one of two $50 E-gift cards. The research has been approved by the University of Alabama Institutional Review Board.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate permission to share it with projects or developer groups.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and consideration. Please let me know if any additional information is needed.</p>

<p>Best regards<br>
