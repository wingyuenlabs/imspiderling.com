<p>I’m getting into game development (mainly mobile &amp; indie games) and I’m trying to choose a game engine.</p>

<p>Between engines like Godot, Unity, Unreal, LibGDX, etc:</p>

<p>Which one would you recommend today?</p>

<p>And why?</p>

<p>I’m mostly interested in 2D / 2.5D, good performance, and a smooth learning curve.</p>

<p>Thanks! 🙏</p>
