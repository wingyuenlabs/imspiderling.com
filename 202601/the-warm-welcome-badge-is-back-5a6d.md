<p>We have a confession to make: We haven't been awarding the Warm Welcome badge as consistently as we should have been. But we're fixing that, starting now!</p>

<p><strong>We're officially bringing back the Warm Welcome badge</strong>, and we're more committed than ever to recognizing the incredible community members who make DEV such a welcoming place.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How It Works
</h2>

<p>Every week, we'll select a handful of individuals based on their participation in the Welcome Thread. </p>

<p>Both new members and existing members can receive the badge:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New members:</strong> Introduce yourself in our <a href="https://dev.to/welcome">welcome thread</a> and really give us a sense of who you are and/or why you've joined the community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Existing members:</strong> Leave warm, helpful, or supportive comments that welcome new users. Show them what makes DEV special by offering thoughtful responses to their introductions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The badge stacks!</strong> Each week is a new opportunity to be awarded, so this isn't a one-and-done situation.</p>

<p><em><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Leave more than one comment to increase your chances of receiving the badge, but remember that quality matters. We're looking for authenticity.</em></p>

<p>Thanks for helping us make DEV the most welcome community for developers! ❤️</p>
