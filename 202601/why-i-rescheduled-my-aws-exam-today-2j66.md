<p>Why I Rescheduled My AWS Exam Today</p>

<p>Yesterday was supposed to be the final day before I took my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner test to get certified. But I did not feel like I was ready. So, before going into the test, I decided to take a final practice exam with 65 questions.</p>

<p>My feeling was that I didn´t do so well. I was right, because I only got 38% on Tutorials Dojo this morning.</p>

<p>Then it was time to decide.</p>

<p>Do I take the test, just do my best and see what happens? <br>
Or do I admit to myself that I was rushing the process to get certified quickly?</p>

<p>I had to face it. I needed more time to understand the core concepts. <br>
I was good on some of the main subjects that are the core of the AWS CCP exam, but not all of them.</p>

<p>I thought I knew most of the answers but under pressure, I mixed them up. <br>
I realized I didn't understand the "Why". <br>
I needed to stop memorizing answers and start understanding the customer scenarios.</p>

<p>I used to get frustrated when I failed practice tests. But if I get 100% on a practice test, I learn nothing. A score of 38% is very painful to me, but it highlights exactly where I need to focus my efforts.</p>

<p>I am not a victim of the exam date. I am the manager of my learning path. <br>
I decide when I am ready. Tomorrow would have been that day, but I chose quality over speed.</p>

<p>When you face choices such as these, it comes down to more than just one thing, one reason why you didn´t just go in and "try". I know I didn´t want to go in and just try. I wanted to pass. I knew if I failed the test, it would crush the confidence I had built up over weeks of preparation.</p>

<p>I admitted my "defeat" to a senior engineer on LinkedIn. Instead of laughing at me, he shared that he postpones exams too. </p>

<p>If you are learning in isolation, every setback feels like the end of the world. But if you share your journey ,even the bad days, you realize everyone struggles at times and it´s okay to admit that.</p>

<p>What's next? <br>
Now, I am not going to guess my way to a pass. I am going to study Support Plans until I dream about them.</p>

<p>To everyone else on this journey: It’s okay to take your time. </p>

<p>We are building a career, not winning a race.</p>
