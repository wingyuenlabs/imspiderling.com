<p>Tutorials are useful.<br>
Courses are helpful.</p>

<p>But growth happens when things break.</p>

<p>I started coding at a young age, and one thing became clear early:</p>

<p>Reading about systems doesn’t teach you how systems fail.</p>

<p>Through FuncLexa, I learned:</p>

<p>How small UI decisions affect users</p>

<p>How backend choices impact scalability</p>

<p>Why clean architecture matters long-term</p>

<p>Why debugging teaches more than success</p>

<p>I don’t chase perfection.<br>
I chase progress through execution.</p>

<p>Every project inside FuncLexa exists to solve a real problem — even if it’s small.</p>

<p>That mindset changed how I learn:</p>

<p>Learn → Build → Break → Fix → Improve</p>

<p>And repeat.</p>

<p>This is how developers grow — not by memorizing syntax, but by shipping.<br>
